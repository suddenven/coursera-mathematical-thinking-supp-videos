[MUSIC]. 
This is the story of how a group of 
gamblers fleeced the casinos for 
millions. 
[NOISE] 
 >> The buzz for me was the potential. 
It was unlimited. 
And I could make money without punching a 
clock. 
I could have a ton of fun. 
Certainly women were going to love me. 
It was great. 
 >> I was excited about the idea of 
goading death with [UNKNOWN]. 
David and Goliath kind of situation. 
 >> And beating them. 
And them not even realizing we're beating 
them. 
 >> But these were no ordinary gamblers. 
They were brilliant students with an 
extraordinary secret, that meant they 
simply couldn't lose. 
But Thorp thought he could do better, 
because he'd realized there was something 
special about Blackjack. 
The odds of winning worked in a different 
way to almost every other gambling game. 
[MUSIC] In terms of mathematical 
probability, gambling games work in one 
of two ways. 
In Russian roulette, a bullet is loaded 
into a barrel of six chambers. 
[MUSIC] [SOUND] Every time the barrel is 
spun, there's a one in six chance of 
firing the bullet. 
[MUSIC] 
 >> When you're playing Russian 
roulette, if you spin the chamber before 
you pull the trigger every time. 
[MUSIC] Then each pull of the trigger is 
an independent event. 
The gun has no memory. 
Spinning the chamber destroys all memory 
of what's happened before. 
 >> [MUSIC] In other words, spin the 
barrel every time and the probability of 
firing the bullet never changes. 
It's always one in six. 
[SOUND] But there's another way of 
playing Russian roulette, where you don't 
spin the barrel between shots but just 
keep on pulling the trigger. 
 >> If it doesn't go off, and you pull 
the trigger again, the second pull of the 
trigger is not an independent event, 
because the odds have changed of you 
getting an explosion. 
 >> Each time the trigger is pulled, the 
probability of firing the bullet falls. 
Initially, from one in six, right down to 
a dead certainty. 
The odds change because they are 
dependent on what has happened on the 
previous pull of the trigger. 
What Ed Thorp realized, was this 
dependence is exactly what happens in a 
game of Blackjack. 
And it's because of how the cards must be 
dealt. 
Critically in most casino games after 
each round the cards are always returned 
to the deck so they can be played in the 
next hand. 
But in Blackjack, used cards are not 
returned, but set aside. 
This means the odds of getting winning 
cards change as the game progresses, 
because the deck is made up of fewer and 
fewer cards for every hand. 
 >> The thing that makes Blackjack 
different is each hand is not an 
independent event, the cards actually do 
have a memory of the previous hands and a 
good player can also have a memory of 
those previous hands.
