00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:09,047
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:13,038
I live and breath mathematics. 
I'm aware of the fact that mathematics is 

3
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:16,451
been invented all the time. 
And yet, I meet people regularly at 

4
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:21,310
parties and elsewhere who say, well, you 
know, what's the interest in mathematics? 

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,950
Didn't the Greeks sort of finish that 
2,000 years ago? 

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,385
And you know, I think, oh my goodness, 
no. 

7
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:29,102
 >> Stanford University Mathematician 
Keith Devlin knows that there are many 

8
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:32,760
reasons to be excited about math, and the 
new ways math is being used today, 

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,108
something called knot theory for example. 
 >> Knot theory actually begins in the 

10
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:41,160
middle of the nineteenth century and it's 
what the name suggests. 

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,130
It's the mathematical study of knots. 
The kind of knots you tie in a piece of 

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,584
string. 
And what distinguishes one knot from 

13
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:51,010
another knot is the pattern whereby you 
wrap the string around itself. 

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,664
But then, in the 1980s, biologists 
started to team up with mathematicians, 

15
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:58,260
not to think about the kind of knots that 
tie them that we can tie in pieces of 

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,160
string. 
But to look at the knots in which our own 

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,724
DNA wraps itself, when it gets inside the 
cell, when it, when it lives inside the 

18
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:11,250
cell, and what a virus does to, to, to 
sort of manipulate that knot pattern. 

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,630
And so, it, it's, it's close to the stage 
now where peoples' lives will be saved 

20
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,698
because mathematicians who know about 
knot theory have teamed up with 

21
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:22,897
biologists to look at the fundamental. 
Maybe, maybe some of the most fundamental 

22
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:27,060
knots that there are, the knots that are 
right down inside our own cells. 

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,700
 >> Devlin spreads the word while 
wearing many hats. 

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,056
Math professor, radio personality, 
television content adviser, author, and 

25
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:37,080
lecturer. 
 >> I've already mentioned the iPod 

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,690
designed just down the road here in sunny 
Cupertino. 

27
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,240
well, those guys are geeks, down the 
road. 

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,740
They are the kind of geeks that 
understand this kind of stuff. 

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,106
So the Fourier's theory that's part of 
the mathematics, behind what's going on 

30
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:55,472
in the you know, and you know, and these 
guys now, you, you've got 60 gigabyte 

31
00:01:55,472 --> 00:02:00,490
memories in some of these things. 
That's enormous amount of storage. 

32
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,530
You can store movies in some, not this 
one, but a bigger one, you can store 

33
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,325
movies in some of these. 
That's because of very, very effective 

34
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:09,902
compression techniques. 
What these things store isn't music or 

35
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:13,760
videos, it's numbers, billions and 
billions of numbers. 

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,298
 >> When you're listening to your 
favorite song, it's easy to forget that 

37
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:22,930
math is behind what makes digital music 
devices and similar technology work. 

38
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,346
But just what specific mathematical 
innovation makes this great escape 

39
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,490
possible? 
An important one is wavelet theory, 

40
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,188
another form of new math. 
 >> A wavelet is a very, very simple 

41
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:37,023
short little wave that will consist of 
maybe one little blip or just a couple of 

42
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:42,188
blips that can be described by a simple 
mathematical formula. 

43
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:45,890
 >> If this doesn't look simple, it's 
because simplicity is relative. 

44
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,930
Equations for curves can be much more 
complex. 

45
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,468
 >> Wavelets were first discovered, or 
invented if you like, early in the 

46
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:57,828
twentieth century. 
But it was only in the 1980s or 90s that 

47
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:01,830
mathematicians began to develop methods 
for dealing with wavelets that allows us 

48
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,252
to take these days, a sound wave, it 
could be a rock group or a two hundred 

49
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:10,174
piece orchestra. 
And reduce them to a mathematical 

50
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:13,672
combination of these little individual 
wavelets as they're called, which are 

51
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:17,605
little pieces of waves that don't keep 
going on forever. 

52
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:21,169
Actually, what's happening is you're 
hearing music that's been created right 

53
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:25,576
there, especially for you. 
Because what's stored inside the device 

54
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:30,490
Is instructions, it's an instruction set 
to recreate that music. 

55
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,882
That instruction set is written in the 
language of mathematics, because the 

56
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:37,433
information that's stored in order to 
recreate the music is actually hundreds, 

57
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:41,440
thousands, maybe millions and billions of 
numbers. 

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,039
One way to think about wavelets and how 
they're used is to think in terms of 

59
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,587
building a house. 
If I were to give you, say five or six 

60
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:52,032
different kinds of bricks, then you know 
and I know that you could go and find an 

61
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:55,689
architect who could use those [UNKNOWN] 
different types of bricks to build houses 

62
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:59,187
of all sizes and all shapes, because it's 
all a matter of how you put those bricks 

63
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:05,025
together. 
Wavelet theory is essentially the same. 

64
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:10,225
It shows you how you can take any sound 
wave or any video signal, any, any image, 

65
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:17,060
and how you can build it up from 
individual little building blocks. 

66
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,916
In this case, the building blocks are 
little graphical waves. 

67
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,946
 >> [MUSIC] And although, wavelet theory 
was developed only decades ago, a short 

68
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:27,976
time in the history of mathematics ideas, 
it was French mathematician Joseph 

69
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:32,283
Fourier who paved the way in the early 
1800s. 

70
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:36,078
 >> He showed that if you take any sound 
wave, actually any kind of wave 

71
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:41,148
whatsoever, you can split it up into 
component sine waves. 

72
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:45,904
A sine wave is the simple up down wave 
that you get when you hit a tuning fork. 

73
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:50,170
You can take any sound wave and split 
that up into individual components. 

74
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,240
You need a lot of them, hundreds or 
thousands of them. 

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,810
Actually, the mathematics says you need 
infinitely many of them. 

76
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,468
What Fourier assured, was that if you 
take a sound wave, a complicated wave 

77
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:03,244
like this one right on the top here, you 
can actually make that by taking very, 

78
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:08,372
very many sound waves. 
Like the one at the bottom of different 

79
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:12,443
amplitudes and frequencies, add them all 
together, and get the complicated sound 

80
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:17,012
wave that we see here. 
So, this complicated sound wave at the 

81
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:20,672
top can actually be built out of 
components, all of which looks like this 

82
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:25,270
one on the bottom. 
 >> It's like the sound of a choir. 

83
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,406
When you listen to many people singing 
together, you hear a group of voices in 

84
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:34,115
unison. 
In effect, a single sound. 

85
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:37,443
Of course, what you're listening to is 
not just a single sound, it's made up of 

86
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:41,306
dozens of voices. 
If you are able to hear each of these 

87
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:45,970
singers separately, you could pick out 
one person's voice. 

88
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,562
The unified sound illustrates the basis 
of Fourier's theory. 

89
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:54,972
 >> [MUSIC] Another way to get a handle 
on Fourier's theory is to use the tuning 

90
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:57,470
fork. 
We'll hit the tuning fork, and if you 

91
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,198
look on the oscilloscope screen, what 
you're getting is an image, a visual 

92
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:03,878
image of the sound. 
And because it's a turning fork making a 

93
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:07,695
pure sound, a pure note, what we're 
seeing is a sine curve. 

94
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:11,233
If we were to take a whole bunch of 
tuning forks and put them together, then 

95
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:17,090
we would be able to create any sound we 
wanted to if we did it the right way. 

96
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,506
For example, if I take another tuning 
fork and I hit the tuning fork, it's a 

97
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:24,722
different size tuning fork, I'm getting a 
different sound. 

98
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:27,584
 >> If you look at the oscilloscope 
tracings from both turning forks 

99
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:30,976
together, you can see how the second wave 
looks like it's moving faster to the 

100
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:36,351
left. 
[MUSIC] This is due to its slightly 

101
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:39,008
greater frequency, but it's still a sine 
curve. 

102
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:42,488
 >> It's because the wave changes in its 
dimensions that when you put them 

103
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:46,148
together, when you put lots of them 
together, what results is not just one 

104
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:50,855
big sine curve. 
But actually, one very complicated curve 

105
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:54,572
with all sorts of different wiggles in 
it, that when you play it back could be 

106
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:59,805
indeed Beethoven's ninth symphony. 
 >> That's part of the basis for today's 

107
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:03,745
digital music players. 
But Fourier's discovery of how sine waves 

108
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:07,462
can be combined to make more complex 
waves has now been advanced into uses of 

109
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:12,250
the simpler little pieces of waves or 
wavelengths. 

110
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,471
Rather than going on and on endlessly, as 
a sign wave does, wavelets, or wave 

111
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:20,540
particles start and stop. 
Why is that important? 

112
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,990
Because the mathematical description of a 
sound wave in terms of sine waves is very 

113
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,340
cumbersome. 
Where as the description in terms of 

114
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,703
wavelets is much simpler and new 
applications for wavelets are always 

115
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:34,780
being developed. 
The FBI uses wavelets to help encode 

116
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,685
their fingerprint database. 
Wavelets are beginning to help with 

117
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:42,188
weather forecasting. 
Keith Devlin, like so many other 

118
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:45,968
mathematicians, is excited to know that 
new mathematics, like recently developed 

119
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:49,748
wavelet theory, are still being invented 
as our new connections between different 

120
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:53,096
types of math, and of course, the new 
high tech developments born out of all 

121
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:58,275
this. 
 >> mathematics is invented all the 

122
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:00,806
time. 
Most of the mathematical knowledge we 

123
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:03,542
have, over half the mathematical 
knowledge we have, was invented by 

124
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:08,780
mathematicians who were living today. 
Mathematics is an incredibly vibrant 

125
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,095
subject. 
I like it, I'm excited by it, and I want 

126
00:08:11,095 --> 00:08:13,885
to, there's a natural human instinct to 
want to share your excitement with 

127
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:17,249
others. 
So when I, when I wrote my book on New 

128
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:20,401
Mathematics, it was an attempt to convey 
to others. 

129
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:23,540
First of all, that New Mathematics is 
happening all the time. 

130
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,350
And secondly, that it's exciting, cool 
stuff. 

131
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,980
And thirdly, and deliberately thirdly, 
it's important stuff that will in fact 

132
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,380
effect everyone's lives 20 or 30 years 
from now.
