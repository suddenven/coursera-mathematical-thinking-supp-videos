1
00:00:00,8 --> 00:00:07,335
Okay[COUGH]. 
Here's a very famous, a historically 

2
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:10,420
famous problem, from al-Khwarizmi's 
Algebra. 

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,302
This is how it was written. 
Doesn't look like algebra today but it's 

4
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:16,933
all language, all words. 
Let me give you, well actually, let me 

5
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,116
read it out. 
Because this was a, a, a modern 

6
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:23,330
translation, a fairly literal 
translation, from al-Khwarizmi's book. 

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,930
If some one say, you divide 10 into two 
parts, multiply the 1 by itself; it will 

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:32,811
be equal to the other taken 81 times. 
Computation; You say, 10 less thing 

9
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:41,570
that's going to be a 10 but it is less 
something. 

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,690
It's a diminish 10, multiplied by itself 
is a 100 plus a square less 20 things. 

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,778
So the less doesn't mean you're 
subtracting, it means it's reduced 

12
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:56,712
somehow and this is equal to 81 things. 
Separate the 20 things from a hundred and 

13
00:00:56,712 --> 00:01:01,688
square and a square and add them to 81. 
It will then be a 100 plus a square, 

14
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:06,524
which is equal to a 101 roots. 
Halve the roots; the moiety and we'll 

15
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,590
come back to that in a minute, is 50 and 
a half. 

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,960
Multiply this by itself, it is 2550 and a 
quarter. 

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,10
Subtract from this 100 the remainder is 
2450 and a quarter. 

18
00:01:18,10 --> 00:01:20,600
Extract the root from this, it is 49 and 
a half. 

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,430
Subtract this from the moiety of the 
roots, which is 50 and a half. 

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,974
There remains 1, and this is one of the 
two parts. 

21
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:33,322
most of us would find that quite 
challenging to to understand let me take 

22
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:37,500
you out of your misery[LAUGH] they were 
solving this. 

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,770
You've got a 10 slimmed down by an amount 
x, you're squaring it and you get 81. 

24
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,532
That's the solution to that. 
And actually if you follow that through 

25
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:48,680
that's just the, the sort of like the way 
we might solve the equation. 

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,523
I'm not going to go through the details, 
but it's sort of like the way you, you 

27
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:56,550
sort of follow that through and 
understand that what you would do. 

28
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,180
bearing in mind that they didn't have 
negatives, but they could move things 

29
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,868
from one side to the other. 
I'm going to move on,[LAUGH] I, you, it 

30
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,952
was really just, the, the, I, I didn't 
want you to spend a lot of time, just to 

31
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:14,610
show you that the way it was laid out 
much simpler, we would think, to just 

32
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,694
solve that equation because we reduced 
algebra to very much just symbolic 

33
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:22,296
manipulation. 
Well the point about solving that 

34
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:24,920
quadratic is you can do it without 
switching your brain on. 

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,946
Once you know the method, you can just 
grind the handle. 

36
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:31,300
It's very much algorithmic. 
Okay so that was al-Khwarizmi. 

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,556
I will mention that al-Khwarizmi, because 
he was describing procedures for doing 

38
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:41,22
arithmetic, especially in his first book. 
Well actually both books. 

39
00:02:41,22 --> 00:02:46,551
Gave birth to the modern word algorithm. 
So the word algorithm for computation 

40
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:52,250
procedure is derived from al-Khwarizmi' . 
So he, he left the word with 2 words 

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,512
algorithm and algebra. 
Pretty, pretty significant. 

42
00:02:56,512 --> 00:03:02,492
Okay, so that how al-Khwarizmi, and 
there's another nice picture for one of 

43
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:06,715
the books. 
Then the next major figure almost 

44
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:13,563
immediately afterwards was Abu Kamil a 
guy who wrote a, many books at least 10 

45
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:18,578
of which we know. 
did a whole bunch of things really 

46
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:21,940
dramatic individual, remarkable 
individual. 

47
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,425
he actually used that equation to solve, 
to calculate the side of a regular 

48
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:30,46
pentagon. 
some very remarkable piece of work.um, 

49
00:03:30,46 --> 00:03:34,834
and the guy was so sort of amazing and 
obsessive one might say that in one case 

50
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:39,622
he looked at many, what is known as 
indeterminate problems, problems where 

51
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:44,486
there's not a unique solution but there 
are many solutions, and in one case he 

52
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:48,240
actually went through and found 2,005, 7, 
676 solutions. 

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,444
Hand calculation of all those many 
solutions. 

54
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:53,586
well you think, there were fewer 
distractions then, right? 

55
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:53,925
 >> Yes. 

56
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,187
 >> So, it was even so that's, that's pretty 

57
00:03:56,187 --> 00:04:00,250
remarkable. 
the next major figure, and there were, 

58
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,31
there were a lot of people involved. 
This was a huge en, en, enterprise going 

59
00:04:06,31 --> 00:04:10,354
on, I'm just mentioning some of the more 
famous people. 

60
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:15,467
And then we've got al-Karaji recognized 
that the sequence. 

61
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:21,430
Well that first remark is really a modern 
interpretation of what he did. 

62
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,614
You have to sort of read it with modern 
eyes, but essentially he realized that 

63
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:30,225
you can keep running up the exponents 
indefinitely. 

64
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:36,680
likewise from a modern perspective, he 
discovered proof by induction. 

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,125
The method of proof by induction where 
you prove the first case and then you're 

66
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,252
sure that if it's true for n it's true 
for n plus 1, for those of you who've 

67
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:47,250
been through that kind of an education. 
it's not explicit in his work but it's 

68
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,282
certainly implicit and some of the 
historians I talked to said that yeah 

69
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:54,82
it's a little bit of a stretch to call it 
induction. 

70
00:04:54,82 --> 00:04:59,230
but from my perspective as a 
mathematician it was induction. 

71
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,369
it depends how you define it. 
I could certainly look at it and see 

72
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:07,0
induction. 
and he verified this which is typically 

73
00:05:07,0 --> 00:05:13,178
done today by induction, that the sum of 
the first n cubed is that formula. 

74
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:19,298
I think I should add some, I think that 
problem is on the test, the problem sheet 

75
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:24,80
that I'm handing out to my student in my 
online class today. 

76
00:05:24,80 --> 00:05:27,750
If it's not today, it's on Wednesday, so, 
don't tell them. 

77
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,990
[LAUGH] Right? 
I think, I think I'm asking them to prove 

78
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,280
this one as an example of induction 
proofs. 

79
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,642
he wrote at least three books. 
then there's the famous Omar Khayyam no 

80
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:44,478
more in the west as a poet I never 
thought his poetry was that good but his 

81
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:49,704
mathematics was brilliant and I think the 
fact he's known as a poet reflects more 

82
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:54,140
on our values in society where we value 
poetry over mathematics. 

83
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,702
I, I wouldn't change the balance the 
other way I'd say. 

84
00:05:56,702 --> 00:06:01,476
I wouldn't want to put them on a battle, 
because they're both important things. 

85
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:08,652
okay yeah but he certainly did some 
spectacular mathematics, worked on 

86
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:15,620
astronomy, calendar reform, a very 
significant figure very, very detailed 

87
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,671
cataloguing of things. 
All the possible kinds of equations, 

88
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:24,820
relating them to geometric constructions. 
His, his book is, is easily available in 

89
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,687
at least three translations, including 
one as recent as last year. 

90
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:34,967
so if cubic's using very intricate 
instructions involving conic sections 

91
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:40,167
methods that are sometimes taught today 
in, in, in classes of fork or some kind 

92
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:44,71
of thing. 
and actually looked at the issue of 

93
00:06:44,71 --> 00:06:49,850
things that could, could, couldn't be 
solved by ruler and compass methods. 

94
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,695
So was very much into the kind of things 
that are still. 

95
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,561
At least in high school geometry courses, 
still very much a focus. 

96
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:06,359
I know, a rather nice picture from this 
manuscript of the cubic equation in this 

97
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:13,424
section of conic section. 
Okay, and then this amazing person, did a 

98
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:19,30
whole bunch of things. 
certainly a child prodigy, he wrote over 

99
00:07:19,30 --> 00:07:24,584
80 books and articles got involved in all 
sorts of other enterprises. 

100
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:29,552
al-Samaw'al. 
And this is really a sort of a quotation 

101
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:36,280
from, I mean, this is a quotation from 
one of his writings. 

102
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,992
He said that algebra involves quote, 
"Operating on unknowns using all the 

103
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:46,160
arithmetical tools, in the same way as 
the arithmetician operates on the known." 

104
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,470
That nails that distinction between 
algebra and, and arithmetic. 

105
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,66
You're using arithmetical tools but, 
you're doing it a different level of 

106
00:07:54,66 --> 00:07:57,438
abstraction. 
You're doing it on the unknowns, which 

107
00:07:57,438 --> 00:08:00,520
means you're sort of doing logical 
reasoning with them. 

108
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,395
You're doing qualitative reasoning in an 
arithmetic framework as opposed to 

109
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:10,960
calculating with the numbers. 
And he, among the things he did was true 

110
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,580
of this result for the sums of the 
squared. 

111
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,500
Again, that's expressing it in modern 
notation. 

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,595
So absent and notation you've got an 
awful lot of modern algebra been on this 

113
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:25,491
period. 
but the story then picks up by Leonardo 

114
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:32,184
and then if we're satisfied with Leonardo 
we can pick up essentially the same story 

115
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:38,780
in terms of spreading the word with Steve 
Jobs, so that was a quick tour through 

116
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:44,384
algebra, the history of algebra up to, 
essentially to modern times.
