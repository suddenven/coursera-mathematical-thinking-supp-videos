1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:10,600
Now let's look at the beginnings of what 
led to modern mathematics and arithmetic, 

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,210
with numbers, addition, multiplication, 
subtraction. 

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,460
I'm, I'm going to guess some kind of 
division came in. 

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:27,265
originally just addition and subtraction. 
The best evidence we have about how ari, 

5
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:32,215
remember that I mentioned counting goes 
back thousands of years, maybe 35,000 

6
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:37,315
BCE, maybe longer, using piles of pebbles 
probably, certainly notches on bones, 

7
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:41,250
probably notches on sticks. 
And the notched bones have been found. 

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,210
You have to interpret what they were used 
for. 

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:52,724
All sorts of theories out there, seasons 
and phases of the moon, and things like 

10
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:55,258
that. 
My guess is the one that doesn't get 

11
00:00:55,258 --> 00:00:59,350
mentioned is probably the one that was 
the most significant, which is probably 

12
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,780
was the early monetary system. 
And I say that because the first real 

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,639
evidence we have for abstract numbers, 
was money. 

14
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,820
Why do we have numbers? 
It was money folks. 

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,578
You want to find new, you want to find 
out where numbers came from, follow the 

16
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:19,45
money[LAUGH]. 
go back to Sumeria and the fertile 

17
00:01:19,45 --> 00:01:23,928
crescent region what's now mainly Iraq, 
and this was about 5,000 BCE. 

18
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:28,589
it, it was period that began then, but, 
but by 5,000 BCE is when we, we 

19
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:33,92
definitely have artifacts that we are 
pretty damn sure, we being the 

20
00:01:33,92 --> 00:01:37,145
anthropologists, not me. 
What the anthropologists are pretty sure 

21
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:41,240
that what happened then was the invention 
of numbers and it was for monetary 

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,186
purposes. 
in other words, you need numbers to have 

23
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:47,896
money. 
Because num, money comes in numerical 

24
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:50,348
quantities. 
One of these, one of those, one of those, 

25
00:01:50,348 --> 00:01:54,172
ten of these. 
the interesting thing is you didn't have 

26
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:59,418
numbers until you needed money, so the 
driving force was mediating human 

27
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:05,578
transactions of goods. 
[COUGH] And the essential reason why 

28
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:10,750
numbers came on was banking. 
Okay, it was essentially the invention of 

29
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,240
banking. 
It was the first bankers. 

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,588
Bankers were the people essentially who 
applied money as mediating quantities in 

31
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:23,195
trade. 
interesting how that has changed, I mean 

32
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:28,598
bankers now apply banking to figments of 
the imagination. 

33
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:28,657
 >> [LAUGH]. 

34
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:32,990
 >> But back then, it was too yeah. 

35
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,950
Back then it was to actual physical 
goods. 

36
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,44
But not quite. 
The vote set in immediately, because 

37
00:02:39,44 --> 00:02:43,734
immediately you introduce money, you've 
got something fictitious whose value 

38
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:48,284
depends purely on, on human agreement. 
Okay, here was the evidence, and it was 

39
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:52,237
discovered in Iraq by Denise 
Schmandt-Besserat, who I think is now 

40
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:55,510
professor Emeritus at the University of 
Texas at Austin. 

41
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,840
She was here on the Sloan Center on the 
hill for a year many years ago. 

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,339
but now she was a young anthropologist 
going out into the fertile crescent 

43
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:09,478
region. 
And all over the place she kept finding 

44
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:14,436
these burial sites and these, these ruins 
of homes and things in which there were 

45
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:17,952
piles of clay tokens. 
Sometimes grouped together in, in ways 

46
00:03:17,952 --> 00:03:22,490
that suggested some kind of an order. 
And they were different shapes. 

47
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,250
some of them looked, recognize but that 
looks like it might be an oil jar, it 

48
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,172
looks like it could be a goose. 
some of them, one of them somewhere looks 

49
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:33,650
as it could be a mill for grinding corn 
or something. 

50
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,690
Some of that looks[INAUDIBLE] some kind 
of a pepper corn. 

51
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,325
So these look as though they might have 
been tokens. 

52
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:44,965
For things that people would trade. 
Jars of oils, bales of hay, geese, oxen, 

53
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:50,880
loaves of bread, and so forth. 
So, the suspicion was, that these were 

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,958
probably tokens to represent your goods. 
If you had 5 geese to sell, you maybe had 

55
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:03,105
5 of these tokens to represent them. 
So the, the supposition was, and this is 

56
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:06,680
a reasonable supposition because the 
Sumerian society was pretty complex. 

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,690
It was getting to be like a modern 
society. 

58
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,667
There was structure in, in the society. 
You know, this was the drive, this was 

59
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:15,440
one of the centers of modern civilization 
coming along. 

60
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,846
And so the supposition she made was that 
these were tokens that represented goods. 

61
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:23,518
Okay. 
And here are some of them and so if you 

62
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:28,133
wanted to trade things you wouldn't 
necessarily have to worry, you would, you 

63
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:32,535
have so many sheep and things but may be 
the sheep be in the field but you have 

64
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:36,720
tokens that represented the sheep. 
So you would instead, so when you sh, you 

65
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,680
trade, you would swap your tokens for 
somebody else's oxen tokens, and then the 

66
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,110
goods would eventually trade. 
And so the tokens you had in your hand 

67
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,790
represented the things you owned. 
That was your bank account, and it was a 

68
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,420
collection of tokens. 
Not unlike a pocketful of change, huh? 

69
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,348
Those were the tokens, except there were 
different tokens for the different 

70
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:03,229
objects with different shapes. 
Okay, so the next thing you need is a way 

71
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,350
of keeping your tokens secure because 
that was a measure of your worth. 

72
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,795
And so bankers came along to look after 
your tokens for you, and what they would 

73
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:15,134
do is you would go along with it, and now 
we're just, I'm telling you the story 

74
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:18,182
that the anthropologists came up with to 
explain what was going on. 

75
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:23,46
The, you came, you went, you had your 
tokens, the banks kept your tokens, they 

76
00:05:23,46 --> 00:05:27,910
would take a sheet of wet clay, put your 
tokens in the clay, fold it up, and seal 

77
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,890
it, bake it in the sun, and there was 
your secure bank account. 

78
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,270
All nice and secure, locked away. 
Okay. 

79
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,924
Now the problem was, of course, if you 
want to trade, you had to break open the 

80
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:42,236
thing. 
Take out the things, change them, and 

81
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:44,630
reseal it. 
Good business to be in banking. 

82
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,844
Constant need for bankers to break open 
the shells and reseal them and put their 

83
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:53,887
stamp on them, okay. 
So already the bankers were there hanging 

84
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:58,674
on, taking our money in the process. 
There's 10% or whatever they would take, 

85
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:02,692
so then, 
Some entrepreneurial person came along 

86
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:07,583
and said, you know, it's fine if we crack 
open the thing when we're actually doing 

87
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,568
a trade. 
But if I'm just making a bid on 

88
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:13,430
something, I don't want to pay the banker 
to break this apart and put it together. 

89
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:19,114
If I want to just show my worth, why 
don't I before you seal up this thing 

90
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:25,150
take the tokens and press them on the 
outside, then put them in and seal it. 

91
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,577
So on the outside of the, of the, of the 
sealed envelope, the clay envelope you've 

92
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:35,842
got tokens, indentations of the tokens so 
you don't have to break it open to see 

93
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:39,56
how many tokens there are. 
You just need to look at the 

94
00:06:39,56 --> 00:06:42,150
indentations. 
That's an advance, okay? 

95
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,48
Your worth, so if you, interesting areas 
of structuring. 

96
00:06:46,48 --> 00:06:51,318
We've now got real sheep and real geese, 
and real jars of oil represented by 

97
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:55,572
artifacts, tokens. 
Tokens are then put into a clay envelope 

98
00:06:55,572 --> 00:07:00,540
and the tokens are now represented by 
marks on the outside. 

99
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,722
We're about to invent writing. 
Writing by the, for those people who like 

100
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:10,74
to think that mathematics is supreme, as 
far as we know, writing numbers came 

101
00:07:10,74 --> 00:07:13,261
before writing words. 
Right, it all began with numbers, and it 

102
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:16,355
was all about money. 
So, they put these tokens out, so you've 

103
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:20,60
got abstract markers, symbols, 
representing the token, the tokens 

104
00:07:20,60 --> 00:07:23,680
represent the objects. 
So, you're already two steps removed from 

105
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,870
the real world, and you've got these, 
these tokens. 

106
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,388
And that was fine for a while, and then 
after, you know, and then 1,000 years 

107
00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:37,488
goes by, and then another entrepreneurial 
person comes along and says, you know? 

108
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:43,494
We don't really need those tokens inside, 
all you need is 1 token for each kind of 

109
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:46,688
object. 
Because you can use the same, same jar of 

110
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:49,980
oil token, three times, if you've got 3 
jar's of oil. 

111
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,940
So you just need different tokens to make 
these indentations. 

112
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,680
But it doesn't matter where these tokens 
are. 

113
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,428
It's really about the indentations. 
The tokens don't matter their just like 

114
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:04,444
the golden fort knox you know, you and I 
don't swap the golden fort knox it's just 

115
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:07,500
there alright, you just go with the 
tokens. 

116
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,708
So, when you do that you can think well 
in that case I don't really need a clay 

117
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:18,210
envelope I can just have a tablet. 
With marks on it, and here is one of the 

118
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,874
tablets. 
So these came later, flat tablets with 

119
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:24,470
the different indentations representing 
in different areas. 

120
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,678
You know, there would be different things 
they're representing. 

121
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:30,176
it could well be that the stock of the 
tokens in different boxes represented 

122
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,602
different kinds of things. 
This was presumably some code, but it got 

123
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:39,810
sophisticated and we have abstract 
markings on a piece of clay that 

124
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:45,494
represents your net worth. 
And if that doesn't look familiar, it 

125
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:46,438
ought to. 

126
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:47,790
 >> [LAUGH]. 

127
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:55,413
 >> 5,000 BCE, we got credit cards,[LAUGH] 
made out of clay. 

128
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:59,59
Okay okay. 
That according to the anthropologists. 

129
00:08:59,59 --> 00:09:03,337
This has been sort of, this is pretty 
well accepted in, in the business. 

130
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:07,546
Their business, not my business. 
I'm, I'm, I'm happy with this. 

131
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:11,203
It seems like a good explanation is where 
we, we have money. 

132
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:16,205
Certainly, numbers came out of that area. 
And this, this, this seems the most 

133
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:19,230
plausible explanation given the available 
evidence. 

134
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:27,908
Okay so that's where we get counting 
numbers, it was for money. 

135
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:33,537
But there was another system of numbers. 
What about the numbers that are used for 

136
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:37,726
building pyramids, measuring volumes of 
things seeing how much land you owe, you 

137
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:40,100
own when the Nile delta, this is the Nile 
Delta. 

138
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,310
When the Nile Delta floods and you have 
to remap the thing? 

139
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,740
there was measurement. 
That was going on as well. 

140
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,851
And one of the interesting things about 
this is to, to modern eyes, those are 

141
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:56,342
both systems of numbers. 
Those give you the natural numbers. 

142
00:09:56,342 --> 00:10:03,110
And that gives you what we call the real 
numbers. 

143
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,180
This is a 19th century, eh, the 1930, 
20th century interpretation. 

144
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,310
These were not thought as numbers. 
They were quantities, lengths, volumes, 

145
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,890
interestingly not areas. 
Areas seem to be cognitively complicated. 

146
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,440
But lengths, and volumes and quantities, 
so these were regarded as essentially 

147
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
separate. 
The Greeks tried to combine them, and 

148
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,550
when they discovered that you couldn't, 
the famous discovery that the square root 

149
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,960
of 2 was irrational, they pushed them 
apart again, and, and they took that as 

150
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,720
meaning that you can't marry, marry these 
with those because of what they call the 

151
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,353
incommensurables. 
You simply couldn't use whole numbers to 

152
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:45,520
capture this. 
Only at the end of the 19th century, 2000 

153
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,420
years later, were mathematicians finally 
able to marry these things together, in a 

154
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,222
single number system called the real 
numbers. 

155
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:58,304
That's very, very recent, and this is 
part of why mathematics got interested in 

156
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:03,28
concepts and relationships because these 
guys took a lot of of building. 

157
00:11:03,28 --> 00:11:09,67
But the reason it took a lot of building 
was cause of these were regarded as 

158
00:11:09,67 --> 00:11:15,304
foundational, and yet these, from a 
cognitive point of view, these are both 

159
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:18,200
basic. 
Human beings have a cognition about 

160
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,360
quantities, discrete quantities. 
We, we can count things. 

161
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,622
We also have sense of lengths and 
volumes. 

162
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:29,904
We have a sense of continuous size. 
So the human cognitive system captures 

163
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:33,770
both and it just took mathematics a long 
time to marry those in a single system. 

164
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:39,380
If you read, read Newton's Principia 
where he talks about the calculus. 

165
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,925
He's not talking about numbers, he's 
talking about quantities. 

166
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:47,389
Calculus in Newton's terms. 
Calculus wasn't applied to numbers, it 

167
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:51,569
was applied to lengths and distances. 
we interpret it today in term's of 

168
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:56,354
numbers, but that's because we have a 
different conception of numbers.
