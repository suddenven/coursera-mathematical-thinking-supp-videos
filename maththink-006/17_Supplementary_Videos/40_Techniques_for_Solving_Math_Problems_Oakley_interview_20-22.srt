1
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:24,240
Doctor Keith Devlin is a very big
guy in the world of math education.

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,050
Not to mention the world of math research.

3
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,040
I'm introducing you to him here because
I love how he thinks about learning in

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,170
the world of mathematics and
how his ideas about learning relate to

5
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,340
learning in all sorts of topics
way outside of Mathematics.

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,510
Among many other duties, Keith is
a co-founder and Executive Director of

7
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,720
Stanford's Human Sciences and
Technology Advanced Research Institute,

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,010
a co-founder and president of
an educational technology company,

9
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,900
BrainQuake that creates
mathematical learning video games.

10
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,700
He's also a world economic forum fellow.

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,040
A fellow of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,480
And a fellow of
the American Mathematical Society.

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,128
Last, but definitely not least, he is
The Math Guy on National Public Radio.

14
00:01:14,128 --> 00:01:17,110
Welcome Dr. Devlin.

15
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,820
Thanks for
being with us here today Doctor Devlin.

16
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's just dive right in.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,560
What's the biggest tip you can
share with our viewers about how to

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,730
most effectively approach a math
problem that they might be stuck on?

19
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,480
Well the first thing of
course is don't panic.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,460
That's the famous Douglas Adams motto.

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,090
From the Hitchiker's Guide to The Galaxy
and it holds just as much for

22
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,360
mathematics as it did for,
for the Hitchiker's Guide.

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,630
You have to begin by understanding
what the problem's about.

24
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,850
What are you trying to do?

25
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,240
What do you want to achieve and
what information do you have?

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,970
You must have, I mean,

27
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,750
you've really gotta avoid the thing that
actually teachers try to impress on you

28
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,180
of trying to see if you can match it
to some template and to act quickly.

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,690
One of the worst things that I think
happens in the school system is people

30
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,320
come away thinking that solving math
problems is something that has to be

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,890
done at speed.

32
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,340
It absolutely is not.

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,720
So you have to sit back take a deep breath
begin by understanding the problem.

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,910
If the problem involves numbers
put in a few simple numbers.

35
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,640
Threes and fours and, and
just play with it to get a sense of it.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,800
If it's a geometric problem do
some little diagrams or you may,

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,430
I often end up writing.

38
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,620
Simple little graph diagrams with dots and
lines connecting them.

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,980
Just something to give me a sense
of what that problem's about.

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,250
At that point, you can ask yourself
do I know any techniques that look as

41
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,980
though they would work for this problem?

42
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,550
If they do and
you're in luck the problem's solved.

43
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,430
Actually that's usually very
unsatisfying because you've just applied

44
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,440
somebody else's thinking.

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,750
Mathematics gets interesting when you,

46
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,690
you have to force yourself to find up
a new, a new method, or some new approach.

47
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,370
So let's just assume that none
of the techniques you know work.

48
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,240
The next thing is,
can I adapt an existing technique.

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,730
Well, maybe you can, maybe you can't.

50
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,920
If you can, that usually leaves you

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,710
with a nice feeling because
you've done something yourself.

52
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,450
The really challenging ones and the ones
where it gets actually exciting and fun.

53
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,120
Is where you,
you it's becomes clear well at least you

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,690
think that nothing you know is
going to help you with that.

55
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,550
At that point what you do is you,
you, you,

56
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,380
you basically you bash away at it several
times with, with just naive approaches.

57
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,690
Almost certain that it won't work.

58
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,180
You just try this you try that.

59
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,040
You, you come up with ideas based
on what the problem's asking you to

60
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,550
do because solving a problem is a journey.

61
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,980
You begin with the information you've got.

62
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,050
Either the information you're
given with the problem or

63
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,150
information you already know.

64
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,860
You may have to add
some extra information.

65
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,740
You may do a Google search find
some extra information about it.

66
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,930
At that point, the journey takes place and
you have to get to the goal and, and

67
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,630
solve the problem.

68
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,700
If none of the methods you try for
the first half hour, maybe I'm,

69
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,480
depending on the problem it could
be half hour, a couple of hours.

70
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,230
Sometimes it's a day or a few weeks.

71
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,710
But if nothing happens, then the best
thing to do is walk away from the problem.

72
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,740
Go and do something else.

73
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,450
In my case for most of my career
I was a long distance runner.

74
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,360
If I really came up against it.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,310
I would put on my running gear, whatever
the weather, and I'd go out for a three or

76
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,690
four hour run.

77
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,610
And when I came back,
a I felt good I felt relaxed and

78
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,410
quite often on the course of that ride or,
or on that, that run or when I

79
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,764
got back the problem seemed different and
I could, I had some new ideas.

80
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:19,014
As I got older my knees gave away from 25
years of heavy duty running these days I

81
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:20,300
ride a bicycle.

82
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,360
But I'd go on my bike, and I'd go for
a three or four hour bike ride.

83
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,630
And I come back, and first of all, I can
approach the problem with a fresh eye.

84
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,670
And secondly, in some cases,

85
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,740
what seemed to be an impossible
problem has melted away.

86
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,840
I look at it and think oh,
gee, that was obvious.

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,330
Why didn't I see it before?

88
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,920
Well, I don't quite think
that because I know that the,

89
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,040
the feeling you have when you
solve a problem is always duh!

90
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,280
Why didn't I think of that before?

91
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,280
And if that doesn't work,
you start the cycle again.

92
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,310
You bash your way at it again, make no
progress and then you go for another

93
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,310
bike ride, or another swim or whatever
it is you like to do, a nice long walk.

94
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,970
But it's important to keep ice to keep
oscillating between bashing away at it and

95
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,530
then backing off and doing something
else to let the brain do it's own thing.

96
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,500
I think that was one of
the hardest things for

97
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,510
me to realize was how
important it is to back away.

98
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,800
That it, that sometimes especially
when it's something difficult it's as

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,920
important to be able to focus on it.

100
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,520
As it is to be able to
back away from it and

101
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,830
then come back later with a fresh
perspective and a fresh mind.

102
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,570
Okay, I, it, for, for difficult problems,
I have never, ever solved a difficult

103
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,850
problem sitting at a desk or even sitting
in my chair, thinking about the problem.

104
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,740
I've never done that and
I'm not sure it's possible to do that.

105
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,840
Because if you think about it, if a
problem's solution requires something new.

106
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,210
Applying all of your conscious
thinking by definition can't solve it

107
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,760
because you're looking for something new.

108
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,500
The weird thing about the brain is
when you've done that preparation of

109
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,950
bashing away without success and
you go and do something else.

110
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,600
I've mentioned physical activity because
I'm a sort of a physical active guy.

111
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,230
Although the biggest result in my PhD,

112
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,830
was actually when I was
getting out of the bath.

113
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,720
I, I, I'd taken a long bath, that you
don't have to sort of exert lots of

114
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,240
energy, you have to do
something different.

115
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,050
Having a bath is a,

116
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,220
is a famous one amongst mathematicians for
solving problems.

117
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,620
But somehow weird stuff happens inside the
brain when you're doing something else.

118
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,300
And what three hours ago seemed
like an impossible problem.

119
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,260
Just melts away and
everything just falls into place.

120
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,900
The brain sorts it out when
it's left alone to do it.

121
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,480
And that's exactly the kinds of ideas that
we're talking about in, in our course.

122
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,810
It is important to do that initial work.

123
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,580
It's no good just going out for
a bike ride.

124
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,460
You've got to have gone through that
process of really coming up against it and

125
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,400
seeing everything that doesn't work
because that seems to set up their mind in

126
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,200
order to do this mysterious stuff it does,
when you're engaged in something else.

127
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,460
When your conscious mind is
engaged in something else.

128
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,470
Absolutely.

129
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,200
It, that's so important.

130
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,350
Well, one thing that you've described,
is that, in higher mathematics.

131
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,570
There should be a lot less doing and
a lot more thinking.

132
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,060
Can you tell our viewers
what you mean by that and

133
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,370
how, how does that relate to areas of
learning that are outside mathematics?

134
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,340
Yeah and this is really where
you've got to unlearn lots of

135
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,690
the things that you're taught at school.

136
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,690
And actually you're taught, teachers do
that for very good reasons because of

137
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,340
the where we, especially in
the United States and parts of Europe,

138
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,370
the way we subject people to endless
test taking in, with timed tests.

139
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,280
The, the way to get through the school
system is to learn to act fast under

140
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,120
pressure of time and that's the last thing
you can do when it comes to mathematics.

141
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,340
You've really got to
let it take its course.

142
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,140
It's not, I mean,
people have different speeds.

143
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,050
I've, I've worked for
some very fast mathematicians,

144
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,450
the the young math professor from Stanford
who won a Field's medal recently.

145
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,670
She has gone on record as saying
her teachers at school thought she

146
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,170
wasn't good at mathematics
because she was so slow.

147
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,690
Well she may be slow, but she now has
the equivalent of a Nobel prize in

148
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,060
mathematics and, and
congratulations to her for doing that.

149
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,350
You really have to let it take its time.

150
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,360
It's a slow process.

151
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,310
You've gotta remember that
mathematics is relatively recent,

152
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,548
you know, 2 or 3,000 years.

153
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:18,360
So you're bringing what's
essentially a stone age brain

154
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,410
to a domain that's a couple
of thousand years old.

155
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,500
In fact, most mathematics
is only a few decades old.

156
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,800
So, how can you take this brain that,
that evolved to survive in the wilds and

157
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,360
to, and then more recently,
to survive in social en, environments.

158
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,250
How can you take that brain and apply just
all this abstract problem in mathematics?

159
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,270
Well the answer is we don't
really know how we do that.

160
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,650
What we do know is that if
you familiarize yourself with

161
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,600
the problem to such an extent that,

162
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,800
that problem is like a member of your
family then the act of solving that math

163
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,820
problem is actually not unlike solving
a difficult problem you have at home.

164
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,180
You know we're very good at
solving social problems and

165
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,890
problems about our environment.

166
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:03,360
Because evolution set us up for that so,
somehow we have to figure out how to

167
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,440
let that brain solve that abstract problem
in mathematics, and the act of getting

168
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,790
inside the problem and thinking about it
for a long period of time, so that it's so

169
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:19,240
familiar then the natural circuits in the
brain that serve us well all of the time.

170
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,770
Actually come into play for
a math problem.

171
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,850
Now, there, there's no proof of that, but

172
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,140
that's certainly my own
experience of what goes on.

173
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,210
Well, all I can say is three cheers for

175
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,090
slow thinking and I love the idea
of thinking about math and a, and

176
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,450
a difficult problem as being something
that's a member of your family.

177
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,350
Yeah, it's you know, I mean.

178
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,630
Math, in many ways
mathematics problems are not,

179
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,980
they're not fundamentally different from
other problems except in one respect,

180
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,670
they're about totally abstract things.

181
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,070
So, someone solving a math problem has an
initial problem that someone doesn't have

182
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,600
if they're solving a problem in
real life or a coaching problem in,

183
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,210
in sort of football.

184
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,320
Or, or, or, or, what and
even most of the time and I,

185
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,300
I used to spend a lot
of time rock climbing.

186
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,410
And rock climbing is, is,
is partly physical but

187
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,210
it's also a lot of problem solving.

188
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,120
Because you're having to look for

189
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,540
these moves, you're having to
move your body in the right way.

190
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,960
So there's an awful lot of problem
solving that we do all of the time.

191
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,250
And that's what the brain evolved to do.

192
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,950
And in the case of mathematics, however,

193
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,110
the world in which you're solving those
problems isn't one we're familiar with.

194
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,900
You initially have to, to create that,
that world in, inside of you, and this,

195
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,080
I think, is why I think it's essential to
knock away at the problem for, for 10,

196
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,570
15 minutes, a day, two days before
you let the brain do its own thing.

197
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,770
My guess and my perception of what's
going on is that, that process is

198
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:44,180
making my mind familiar with that domain
with that problem to such an extent that,

199
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,986
that problem is just like
a problem I'd have with my family.

200
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:50,480
Or, or, or, or my workplace or whatever.

201
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,279
I've got all of this apparatus for solving
real world problems and social problems.

202
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,770
And once that math problem is inside my
mind, it's another problem just like that.

203
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,360
So solving the math problem
usually isn't the hard part.

204
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,310
The hard part is getting that
problem familiar inside your mind.

205
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,170
And the only way to do that is
just keep living in the problem.

206
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,520
Get inside the problem.

207
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,550
Really.

208
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,560
Live inside that problem for ten minutes,
half an hour, maybe even a few days.

209
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,676
In the case of Andrew Wile, solving
Fermat's last theorem a few years ago.

210
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:25,930
It took him seven years to
really get inside that problem,

211
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,390
to the point where we
could see the solution.

212
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,420
We'll part of what you do when your
spending a lot of time with a problem is

213
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,700
you're in some sense reaffying and
growing the neural structures that

214
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,930
are related to what you're
trying to think about.

215
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,550
And one of the things that Doctor Synoski
and I emphasized quite strongly in our

216
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,520
course is how exercise
helps actually build neural

217
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,920
structures it, it allows you to learn
better it allows you mem, remember better.

218
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,640
So how, how does exercise play a role
in your own ability to do mathematics?

219
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,610
That's that's a good one.

220
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,400
But it certainly is the case for
me if, when I was a PhD student, and

221
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,710
my closest colleague was a, was a,
was a, a mathematician from from

222
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,180
the United States, came over to England
when I was a student back in Bristol.

223
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,120
And he was a rock climber.

224
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,140
In fact I learned to rock climb with him.

225
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,720
And we used to go on these three or
four hour rock climbs and, and.

226
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,930
We would almost certainly
by the time we got to the,

227
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,510
to the top of the climb we'd done some
mathematics because you do a climb and

228
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,900
you get to a ledge and you're, you're
tied up and then you chat for a while.

229
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,840
As you're sort of belayed
onto the rock face.

230
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,030
And we'd talk about mathematics.

231
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,270
And then we'd forget the mathematics and

232
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,335
we'd do onto the physical
stuff of climbing.

233
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,680
And when you're climbing as,
as when you're bicycling very fast.

234
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Your mind is totally focused
on that physical activity.

235
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,270
That's, your entire world is physical.

236
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,920
So you're focused on the climbing, or
you're focused on riding your bike.

237
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,160
And, but stuff is going on in
the background in your mind.

238
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,560
It's working on those things
that you've talked about.

239
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,190
And we'd finish a pitch, we'd put,

240
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,440
get ourselves back on [INAUDIBLE],
we'd talk about the problem.

241
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,180
And we've made progress on the problem.

242
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,200
So, as a graduate students,

243
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,910
I discovered this method of thinking,
doing, thinking, doing.

244
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,860
It was incredibly powerful.

245
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,740
You know, I can mix conjectures and,

246
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,540
and sort of self reflect as to why
the physical activity is important.

247
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,580
I mean, aspects clearly are.

248
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,630
You're focusing on that activity.

249
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,230
It's very refreshing you know, the,

250
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,710
we tend to think these days that
the mind is separate from the body.

251
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,760
I don't buy that.

252
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,040
It certainly isn't the case for me.

253
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,020
I find that if my body's tired
my mind is tired and vice versa.

254
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,192
They stimulate each other.

255
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:41,430
So the, you know, the mind did
evolve to help the body survive, and

256
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,820
I think it's, it's a mistake to try and
think of those as separate.

257
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,310
If you nurture the body, the mind follows.

258
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,550
You know, this, this goes back to the days
of having physical education in schools

259
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,380
and so forth, this is hardly original,
but I think we need to take it seriously.

260
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,670
I've never, ever,
well I have solved problems in the bath.

261
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,230
That's a, that's a,
that's a somewhat more relaxing case.

262
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,050
But even in the bath, it's simply,
you know, it's a, it's a,

263
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,610
it's an artificial environment
in which you're relaxed.

264
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,830
You're in water, you're doing things,
you're fresh, you're freed of the mind.

265
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,010
The mind is absolutely not
thinking about that problem.

266
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,780
It's doing other things.

267
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,720
In my case definitely the, the bath,
the bath examples not withstanding.

268
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,480
Physical activity plays a big role.

269
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,790
Exactly why, I don't know.

270
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,115
But I do know it works.

271
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:26,700
[LAUGH].

272
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,220
Well there is actually good research
evidence they're uncovering the,

273
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,560
the bio-physiological mechanisms
by which it does take an affect.

274
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:41,650
But I, I have to ask, with everything
that you do, do you ever catch yourself?

275
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,470
It's hard to believe, but
do you ever procrastinate?

276
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,955
And if you do,
what do you do to get yourself out of it?

277
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,690
[LAUGH] yeah.

278
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,050
Well, first of all, I do, do many things.

279
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,080
You know?
I've got my own

280
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,620
educational technology company.

281
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,510
I do lots of biking.

282
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,280
I, I run an institute at Stanford.

283
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,670
I do my teaching.

284
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,430
I do, I'm actually on Twitter a lot.

285
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,140
I do a whole bunch of things.

286
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,040
You might think I'm a multitasker.

287
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,160
I absolutely do not multitask.

288
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,310
Not least, because I know,

289
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,370
from the research that's
been done here at Stanford.

290
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,860
A lot of it by my late colleague,
Cliff Nass.

291
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,210
That shows that a, human beings
cannot multitask and b, the more you

292
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,920
think you're good at multitasking
the worse you are at doing it,

293
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,220
so I absolutely don't try to use
the serial processor to multitask.

294
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,700
What I do is I serial task.

295
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,040
I will work exclusively flat out for
periods of time.

296
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,030
Now they may only be ten minutes.

297
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,670
They may be half an hour.

298
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,750
Or they may be I mean recently I had
to develop a whole set of 75 puzzles.

299
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,530
A new set of puzzles for, for

300
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,230
my educational video game
that we launched last fall.

301
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,120
And we wanted to bring
out a different version.

302
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,490
I worked nonstop on that for four days.

303
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,310
I didn't do anything else other than eat,
sleep and

304
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,100
bicycle ride and my entire focus
everything else went to one side.

305
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,280
Was to get that thing done.

306
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,240
And four days later I had
the 75 puzzles worked and

307
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,030
tested and everything and
then I moved to something else.

308
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:04,720
So what I do is I worked very intensely
and very focused for periods of time.

309
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,070
I mean, you know, it's amazed that, that,
that friends and family are still by me

310
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,230
because this is very focused and
it excludes everything else.

311
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,150
You know must I must be really
difficult to live with at those times.

312
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,390
But everything gets excluded.

313
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,130
I focus on it.

314
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,300
And then I it comes an end.

315
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,880
Either because I finished the job or
I just get tired and

316
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,640
want to switch and I'm really getting,
getting frustrated with it.

317
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,020
Then I'll switch and do something else.

318
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,890
And what I've learned to do
very efficiently is switch from

319
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,460
one to the other.

320
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,130
It doesn't take me more than a few minutes
at most to switch from one to the other.

321
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:42,290
Procrastination comes from recognizing
that I need to make that switch.

322
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,390
I'll keep going and keep going, and

323
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,500
I'll think I want to do this little thing,
I want to do this little thing.

324
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,230
And I do find myself doing
lots of other little things.

325
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,885
I'll go start to read my Twitter feed and
things for

326
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,080
awhile, before making the switch.

327
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,190
So the one moment where I will
procrastinate is starting something new,

328
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,570
for obvious reasons.

329
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,080
You've been in the groove, you've been
making progress, and then it slowed down.

330
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,000
And you've got to get in another groove.

331
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,860
And, and I know that that
takes willpower and effort.

332
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,960
And like everybody else,
I do have a procrastination streak.

333
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,050
But the only time it affects
me is making that switch.

334
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,720
Once I've done it, I'm away in that domain
until I've either solved that issue, or

335
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,260
done it, or completed it.

336
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,530
Or got tired of it, and need a break.

337
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,870
And that, I found, works extremely well.

338
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,910
That, that's actually something
that we talk about in this course,

339
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,340
is just that idea of, you don't
need to use willpower all the time.

340
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,270
You just need to put it one little place,
wherever you need.

341
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,050
Where you're getting that cue.

342
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,800
That's where you need to
be applying willpower and

343
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,380
that seems to be exactly what you do.

344
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,710
And it's true that I'm fortunate to
have been able to carve out a career for

345
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,780
myself where most of the time I'm
doing stuff I really want to do.

346
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,610
So even though I may not want
to write that blog post.

347
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,400
I know at the back of my mind
that the moment I get into it and

348
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,140
written a fair sentences.

349
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,250
Writing that blog post will be the most
important, and most wonderful, and

350
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,600
rewarding thing in the world,
until it's finished.

351
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,420
But then I have to sort of stop that and
do something else.

352
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,070
And that's when there's these hiatus
moments when, when I procrastinate.

353
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,040
It's the, the, the, the switching gears to
something else that, that's, that I find,

354
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,380
I won't say I find it difficult,
because I've been doing it all my life.

355
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,740
But you do need willpower to do that.

356
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,330
At least I find I need willpower
to do that and if I'm not careful,

357
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:32,770
it will just fritter away with
social media or or whatever.

358
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,930
I, I feel the same way
in how I handle things.

359
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,030
One thing I, I like to do is.

360
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,670
I think of my life as like
this enormous funnel where

361
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,120
there's all these things that
are demanding to be done.

362
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,660
But then only one thing can go
through the funnel at a time.

363
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,330
And so you, you just gotta give it up and

364
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,260
realize one thing is all
you can be focusing on.

365
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,990
And if you have that approach it makes it

366
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,530
a little easier to realize that
you just can't do everything.

367
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,790
You just do as much as you reasonably.

368
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,630
Yeah.
I mean, I mean one thing I do,

369
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,050
do is when you know, I actually just
upgraded my computer system to a,

370
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,990
to a new Macintosh.

371
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,340
The first thing I did was went to the.

372
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,260
Into the system controls and
switched off every single alert.

373
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,560
I don't want visual alerts,
I don't want noise alerts,

374
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,990
I don't want to know if an email has come.

375
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,720
I don't want to know if
something's going on.

376
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,910
I literally switch off all the alerts
because I don't want things pushed to me.

377
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,640
I want to go and find out things when
I need them because the last thing I

378
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,155
want if I am in the middle of
working on an article say.

379
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:37,130
Is to have some little mip,

380
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,800
little beep going off to tell
me some emails has arrived.

381
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,920
I don't want to know that,
because that's a distraction.

382
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,370
I want to be in the world
of writing that article,

383
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,030
because if you take this human brain,
and you put it into a problem,

384
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,160
into a domain, and you set it free,
it loves what it's doing,

385
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,580
it doesn't want to give up, and
it sure doesn't want to be distracted.

386
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,730
And so, I don't destruct it.

387
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,980
I just let it do what it does.

388
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,050
Well, I, I thank you so
much, Doctor Devlin, for

389
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,760

390
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,500

pleasure talking with you.

391
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,140

learn a lot from what you had to say.

392
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,650

absolutely.

393
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,732
