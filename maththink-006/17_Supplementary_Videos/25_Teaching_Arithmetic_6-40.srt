1
00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:05,886
Now here, and this also goes for, for 
most of Europe, western Europe at least 

2
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:10,826
certainly for these countries that are 
essentially capitalist. 

3
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:15,630
we build our number system on commerce 
and trade. 

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,779
Okay, we start with counting numbers and 
elementary arithmetic. 

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,930
And this is typically how we teach kids 
in, in arithmetic. 

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,602
Then we proceed to fractions, then we 
introduce negative numbers as best you 

7
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:31,296
can, it's tricky that one. 
Smart kids ask questions that are very 

8
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:34,998
difficult to answer. 
then we slip in real numbers under the 

9
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:39,108
heading algebra, we just, we pretend 
there's not a problem there. 

10
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:44,113
And from the point of view of a teacher 
the first step is pretty good, there were 

11
00:00:44,113 --> 00:00:48,360
good metaphors for counting, I mean, you 
list all you can't count. 

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,40
You can think of all sorts of metaphors 
for dealing with positive numbers. 

13
00:00:51,40 --> 00:00:54,926
fractions is pretty good, you can talk 
about breaking things away, I mean you 

14
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:58,580
know, American mathematics book are 
talking about pizzas, but I guess that 

15
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,100
reflects just American diet. 
European text books we, we cut up 

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,130
straight lines, and squares, and 
rectangles, and pies, actually we don't 

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,120
cut up pizzas in Europe, we cut up pies. 
Which is misleading, because pie tends to 

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,12
mean something else, but anyway. 
but there are good metaphors about 

19
00:01:14,12 --> 00:01:18,279
sharing out infractions. 
maybe the numbers are sort of, you, you 

20
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:23,650
read all sorts of weird stuff about, 
helium balloons on balances, and things. 

21
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,458
which is a really weak and misleading 
metaphor, but anyway, there's, there's 

22
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,980
also some problems here, and and kids 
sort of get lost. 

23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,756
And, many in[UNKNOWN] has enormous 
trouble really knowing what negative 

24
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:37,473
numbers are, you know, minus times minus 
equals plus the reason why we won't 

25
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:40,978
discuss. 
[LAUGH] it was, it was[UNKNOWN] I think 

26
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:43,917
it was. 
[NOISE] And in fact, most people actually 

27
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:47,830
can't give a good explanation of why 
minus one times minus one is plus one. 

28
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,350
And it's not 'cuz they're stupid, it's 
because it's actually kind of a tricky 

29
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,214
thing to do. 
and this one, this is the famous don't 

30
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:56,422
ask, don't tell policy. 
You just don't raise the issue, you just 

31
00:01:56,422 --> 00:01:59,810
say, well, there's no problem here, we 
just have these continuous lines. 

32
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,857
and, and then students get to university, 
and they look at the construction of the 

33
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,505
real numbers from the rational numbers 
they think,[SOUND] I'm not going to be a 

34
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:11,106
mathematician. 
[COUGH] OK and that's more or less a 

35
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:17,109
historical thread, starting in Sumeria 
and going through sort of commerce driven 

36
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:19,984
society. 
In fact, the rest of today's lecture is 

37
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:24,724
going to be about how it came. 
The Western Europe and then the United 

38
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:28,900
States was the dominant economic power 
for many centuries. 

39
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,170
Why is the word banking from an Italian 
word, why is the word policy from an 

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,790
Italian word, why is double entry book 
keeping coming out of Italy. 

41
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,130
Why are financial districts often called 
long bad street, why is all of the 

42
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,100
terminology about banking and finance and 
insurance and international trip, why is 

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,229
so much of that Italian? 
I'll come to that in the second half of 

44
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:53,94
the lecture. 
That was a case where mathematics really 

45
00:02:53,94 --> 00:02:57,384
drove modern society and gave dominance 
to first Italy and then Germany, then 

46
00:02:57,384 --> 00:03:02,745
Western Europe and then Unites States. 
And just took over from the rest of the 

47
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:05,220
world in economics. 
And with it, science as well. 

48
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,220
Why is it that Galileo was in Pisa? 
Just it, why did it all happen in Italy? 

49
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,2
Something happened there. 
Well, several things happened, but, one 

50
00:03:15,2 --> 00:03:18,588
of them was to do with the, with this 
sequence of learning. 

51
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:21,564
But there's another way you could learn 
about[INAUDIBLE] , the[UNKNOWN] 

52
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:24,150
educational system. 
And this one was developed in the Soviet 

53
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,562
Union. 
I'm not sure if it's still used very much 

54
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:29,853
in Russia,[COUGH] . 
this is known as the, the Davydov 

55
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:33,292
curriculum. 
who was a Russian psychologist and 

56
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:36,314
educator. 
Died not, not that long ago, Vasily 

57
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:39,944
Davydov. 
And he said we should start with the, you 

58
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:43,830
see, the problem with that last picture 
was going from the rationals, what, the, 

59
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,310
the negative numbers is a problem, but 
going to the real numbers is a real 

60
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,370
problem. 
You've got the don't ask, don't tell 

61
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,856
policy. 
It's really very difficult conceptually, 

62
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:58,532
and he said, we've got a concept of, of 
measurement, that predates, by hundreds 

63
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:04,210
of thousands of years, counting, namely, 
measurements of lengths and things. 

64
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,880
Most creatures have a sense of distance 
and length. 

65
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,344
They use it to sort of catch prey, to 
swing from tree to tree, I mean, there's 

66
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:16,96
an innate sense of distance, in many 
creatures, much more sophisticated than a 

67
00:04:16,96 --> 00:04:20,326
sense of con, of con, of counting. 
Counting is, discreet counting is much 

68
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,702
more restrictive in the, in the animal 
world. 

69
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:27,566
Okay, so, most creatures, including 
humans, have this very rich sense of, of 

70
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:31,592
quantative measurement. 
He said we should build our number system 

71
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:35,536
and, we should begin with the real 
numbers, and with algebra, and then 

72
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:38,896
arithmetic will drop out as a special 
case, which is true. 

73
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:44,209
because when you have the real numbers, 
the natural numbers are just points on a 

74
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:48,10
line, and it's just a particular instance 
of these things. 

75
00:04:48,10 --> 00:04:54,107
So he said it's better to begin with this 
rich sense of distance and volume that we 

76
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:58,714
had for a millennia. 
[COUGH] and in building a curriculum he 

77
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:04,275
took Vygotsky's ideas and talked about 
spontaneous concepts by scientific 

78
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:09,338
concepts and these are all technical 
terms, which I won't go into details 

79
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:13,810
about but we can chat about them offline 
sometime. 

80
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,806
Spontaneous concepts, when children just 
abstract from everyday experiences. 

81
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:23,330
But human beings don't just abstract, 
they theorize. 

82
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,368
And they can theorize from a very early 
age, and in fact they do, I mean, very 

83
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:30,50
young children theorize a lot of things. 
They form theories at a very early age. 

84
00:05:30,50 --> 00:05:34,850
And he says with a bit of, with a bit of 
nudging, you can take those ideas, of the 

85
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,266
theorizing capacity and develop what he 
calls scientific concepts. 

86
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:44,130
And this allows you to build a curriculum 
in which you get very naturally, at a 

87
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,950
very early age, from the age of something 
like six to eight. 

88
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,600
You can begin by doing algebra and 
solving equations, and then arithmetic 

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,248
follows special cases. 
If you are interested, I have a, an 

90
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:59,130
online column called Devling's Angle that 
the MEA. 

91
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:05,998
If you just type Devling's Angle and you 
go back to 2008, 2009, Christmas around 

92
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,289
2008, 2007. 
I actually had two articles on these. 

93
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:11,360
it's actually hard to find much about 
this. 

94
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,570
This is written about a lot in the 
educational research literature. 

95
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,466
my two articles are almost the only 
articles I've seen and come across that 

96
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:23,894
tries to explain these things to a 
general audience. 

97
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:28,997
But there's another way, and so these 
different cognitions can be taken 

98
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,855
advantage of for educational purposes. 

99
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:34,151
[MUSIC] 

100
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:40,403
Stanford University.
