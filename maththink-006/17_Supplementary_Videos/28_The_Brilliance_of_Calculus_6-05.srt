1
00:00:00,2 --> 00:00:03,862
 >> Okay, yes. 

2
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:11,872
 >> derivatives be a combination or use of 
algorithms? 

3
00:00:11,872 --> 00:00:13,983
 >> You mean in, in the terms of calculus? 

4
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:14,760
 >> [INAUDIBLE]. 

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,830
 >> Oh, actually I, one of the things I, I 

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,778
probably will do is do a half a session 
on calculus. 

7
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:23,618
Because calculus is the, is the modern 
technology well, without calculus we 

8
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:27,478
wouldn't have modern technology. 
And calculus so I'm going to differ with 

9
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:31,74
detailed answer so I will definitely now 
next week, if I'm going to talk about 

10
00:00:31,74 --> 00:00:34,66
next week is calculus. 
Because it needs, it needs more than a 

11
00:00:34,66 --> 00:00:38,180
quick answer but let me give you a quick 
answer any way because I'm on a roll now. 

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,331
Okay, 
The brilliance of calculus and its 

13
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:45,930
absolutely brilliant is, it takes 
something and its, its almost the same 

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,354
brilliance as algebra. 
in that sort of take something that's 

15
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:53,514
intrinsically difficult in that case, 
tedious because you're doing the same 

16
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:57,930
calculation many times and by[INAUDIBLE] 
up the abstraction instead of having to 

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,218
do the same calculation many times, you 
have a general method, a formula that you 

18
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:06,257
can just apply without thinking. 
That's what calculus, calculus takes an 

19
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:10,597
incredibly difficult problem involving 
rates of continuous change which when you 

20
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:14,441
analyze it involves talking about 
infinitesimal increments, and things 

21
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,781
changing of infinitesimal amounts of time 
gets very deep both philosophically and 

22
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:22,687
computationally in terms of[UNKNOWN] 
conceptually Philosophically and 

23
00:01:22,687 --> 00:01:26,469
conceptually difficult because you're 
dealing with these infinitely, 

24
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,774
infinitesimally small things and so 
forth. 

25
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:31,860
Okay. 
Very challenging, very, very difficult. 

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,450
In the seventeenth century it was a major 
headache for people to do it. 

27
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,740
Archimedes had struggled with it 
thousands of years earlier, got results 

28
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,766
but it was very hard to understand 
exactly what it meant, how to make sense 

29
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:46,753
of it. 
What calculus does is take something 

30
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:51,330
extremely difficult, and turning it into 
a mindless algorithm. 

31
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,283
Calculus is just a set of syntactic 
rules, that allow you to work out the 

32
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:58,90
answers to things involving continuous 
change. 

33
00:01:58,90 --> 00:02:01,360
It took it from one end of the spectrum 
to the other. 

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,280
Calculus starts with something that is 
conceptually intellectual, unbelievably 

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,220
challenging. 
The infinite is something that the human 

36
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,120
mind literally can't grasp, and yet it 
rears its head as soon as you start 

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,920
looking at infinitesimal changes in 
continuity. 

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,795
It takes that extremely deep stuff that 
our minds can't fully wrap around, and 

39
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:24,84
reduces it to a completely mindless set 
of symbolic manipulation. 

40
00:02:24,84 --> 00:02:28,510
That is technology written large. 
Take something complicated and would use 

41
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,766
it to something just push buttons. 
Calculus was one of the World's first 

42
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:36,872
great conceptual technology. 
Technology in a sense that it's a black 

43
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:39,720
box, you plug something in and the answer 
comes out. 

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,780
Magic happens inside, Magic happens 
inside Calculus. 

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,598
I became a mathematician when I met 
Calculus in my last year of high school. 

46
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,551
I thought Calculus, I thought mathematics 
was kinda[UNKNOWN], I was going to be a, 

47
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:54,672
I was going to go to university 
Physicist, I wanted to do Physics. 

48
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:56,670
I went to high school when Sputnick went 
up. 

49
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,440
I mean I thought space exploration all 
this stuff so, so I went to univ, I was 

50
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,745
going to go to university to do physics. 
Spent all my time doing physics, wasn't 

51
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:06,326
particularly good at mathematics. 
Well, that's not true. 

52
00:03:06,326 --> 00:03:10,106
I, I wasn't gifted at mathematics, but I 
needed to do it for physics, so I put a 

53
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,946
lot of effort into any mathematics, which 
I viewed as a set of tools that would 

54
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:17,611
help me in physics. 
Then in after my first year of sixth form 

55
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:21,990
when I'm sort of 17, getting into the 
last year of high school. 

56
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,610
We start doing calculus. 
We started really doing calculus. 

57
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,185
I mean just looking at what the 
definition of the derivative and so 

58
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:30,714
forth. 
And I'm presented with this stuff that A, 

59
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:33,850
is obviously very powerful. 
It allows you to calculate you know, 

60
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,830
where the moon's going to be 3 weeks from 
now. 

61
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,450
It allows you to calculate all these 
other things. 

62
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,734
It's going to, it allows you to calculate 
what's going to happen to a spinning top 

63
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:45,433
when it starts to slow down. 
It allows you to calculate all of these 

64
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,459
wonderful predictive things with 
incredible accuracy, and yet I have no 

65
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,672
idea how it worked. 
And for me to have something that was 

66
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:57,157
thrust upon me that was clearly powerful, 
and worked, and in a sense was simple 

67
00:03:57,157 --> 00:04:01,642
because you know you look that, a couple 
of pages of the textbooks that is how it 

68
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,530
works. 
Make no sense to me. 

69
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,275
And I'm that kind of guy who wants to 
lift the hood up and see what's going on 

70
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,108
here. 
so for me, what turned me into a 

71
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:12,804
mathematician, was realizing that there 
was something powerful that I didn't 

72
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:15,324
understand. 
And it took me many years to understand 

73
00:04:15,324 --> 00:04:17,620
it, and by the time I did, I was a 
mathematician. 

74
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,439
because once you've got it, it was funny, 
because most of the other kids in the 

75
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,700
class, and, and at the beginning, my 
teacher, said look. 

76
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,630
Here's the formula, if you differentiate 
x to the n, you get nx to the n minus 1. 

77
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,250
Just use the sucker, and get the problem 
solved. 

78
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,962
And I was that kid that kept saying, yeah 
okay, but where did that formula come 

79
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:38,450
from, why does that formula work? 
And I was the only kid in the class, 

80
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,545
including the teacher, actually, who 
really worried about why that was the 

81
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,864
case. 
you know, that was clear, that was the 

82
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:47,992
point where I became a mathemetician. 
Because everybone else was content to 

83
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:52,82
just use it and get the answer. 
And for me, the fact that they could that 

84
00:04:52,82 --> 00:04:55,640
without understanding it, is what made it 
interesting. 

85
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,58
because I wanted to know what Newton was 
thinking when he came up with that thing 

86
00:04:58,58 --> 00:05:01,940
or what[UNKNOWN] was thinking. 
So I'll come back to that next week. 

87
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,306
It's really good question and it's a big 
answer and it's the that our modern, and 

88
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,220
we're doing big themes. 
We've already looked at numbers. 

89
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,586
What's the biggest invention that 
mathematicians have produced that changed 

90
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:14,340
the world? 
Hindu arabic numerals. 

91
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,840
That's fundamental to modern life for 
everybody. 

92
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,960
So that was the biggest one I would say. 
What's the next biggest one? 

93
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,110
Probably algebra, which is more efficient 
ways of dealing with numbers. 

94
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,78
And the next one's going to be calculus 
because that gives us, because the first 

95
00:05:27,78 --> 00:05:30,311
one gives us all our commerce in our 
financial business, in our, you know, 

96
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:33,100
quantative stuff, money, began with 
money, as far as we know. 

97
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,130
All of that comes on from the numbers, 
and on the other side we've got calculus, 

98
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,920
that gives us all our modern science and 
technology. 

99
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,988
So these are big, big themes. 
okay. 

100
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:47,816
That was slightly more than a little 
digression, but I'll come back to 

101
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:50,980
calculus next time. 
Okay, shall we take a break now? 

102
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,104
Let's take a break now and then we'll 
come back, and we'll talk about how we 

103
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:59,272
[INAUDIBLE] count the votes in an 
election.
