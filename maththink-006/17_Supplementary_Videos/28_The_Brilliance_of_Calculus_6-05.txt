 >> Okay, yes. 
 >> derivatives be a combination or use of 
algorithms? 
 >> You mean in, in the terms of calculus? 
 >> [INAUDIBLE]. 
 >> Oh, actually I, one of the things I, I 
probably will do is do a half a session 
on calculus. 
Because calculus is the, is the modern 
technology well, without calculus we 
wouldn't have modern technology. 
And calculus so I'm going to differ with 
detailed answer so I will definitely now 
next week, if I'm going to talk about 
next week is calculus. 
Because it needs, it needs more than a 
quick answer but let me give you a quick 
answer any way because I'm on a roll now. 
Okay, 
The brilliance of calculus and its 
absolutely brilliant is, it takes 
something and its, its almost the same 
brilliance as algebra. 
in that sort of take something that's 
intrinsically difficult in that case, 
tedious because you're doing the same 
calculation many times and by[INAUDIBLE] 
up the abstraction instead of having to 
do the same calculation many times, you 
have a general method, a formula that you 
can just apply without thinking. 
That's what calculus, calculus takes an 
incredibly difficult problem involving 
rates of continuous change which when you 
analyze it involves talking about 
infinitesimal increments, and things 
changing of infinitesimal amounts of time 
gets very deep both philosophically and 
computationally in terms of[UNKNOWN] 
conceptually Philosophically and 
conceptually difficult because you're 
dealing with these infinitely, 
infinitesimally small things and so 
forth. 
Okay. 
Very challenging, very, very difficult. 
In the seventeenth century it was a major 
headache for people to do it. 
Archimedes had struggled with it 
thousands of years earlier, got results 
but it was very hard to understand 
exactly what it meant, how to make sense 
of it. 
What calculus does is take something 
extremely difficult, and turning it into 
a mindless algorithm. 
Calculus is just a set of syntactic 
rules, that allow you to work out the 
answers to things involving continuous 
change. 
It took it from one end of the spectrum 
to the other. 
Calculus starts with something that is 
conceptually intellectual, unbelievably 
challenging. 
The infinite is something that the human 
mind literally can't grasp, and yet it 
rears its head as soon as you start 
looking at infinitesimal changes in 
continuity. 
It takes that extremely deep stuff that 
our minds can't fully wrap around, and 
reduces it to a completely mindless set 
of symbolic manipulation. 
That is technology written large. 
Take something complicated and would use 
it to something just push buttons. 
Calculus was one of the World's first 
great conceptual technology. 
Technology in a sense that it's a black 
box, you plug something in and the answer 
comes out. 
Magic happens inside, Magic happens 
inside Calculus. 
I became a mathematician when I met 
Calculus in my last year of high school. 
I thought Calculus, I thought mathematics 
was kinda[UNKNOWN], I was going to be a, 
I was going to go to university 
Physicist, I wanted to do Physics. 
I went to high school when Sputnick went 
up. 
I mean I thought space exploration all 
this stuff so, so I went to univ, I was 
going to go to university to do physics. 
Spent all my time doing physics, wasn't 
particularly good at mathematics. 
Well, that's not true. 
I, I wasn't gifted at mathematics, but I 
needed to do it for physics, so I put a 
lot of effort into any mathematics, which 
I viewed as a set of tools that would 
help me in physics. 
Then in after my first year of sixth form 
when I'm sort of 17, getting into the 
last year of high school. 
We start doing calculus. 
We started really doing calculus. 
I mean just looking at what the 
definition of the derivative and so 
forth. 
And I'm presented with this stuff that A, 
is obviously very powerful. 
It allows you to calculate you know, 
where the moon's going to be 3 weeks from 
now. 
It allows you to calculate all these 
other things. 
It's going to, it allows you to calculate 
what's going to happen to a spinning top 
when it starts to slow down. 
It allows you to calculate all of these 
wonderful predictive things with 
incredible accuracy, and yet I have no 
idea how it worked. 
And for me to have something that was 
thrust upon me that was clearly powerful, 
and worked, and in a sense was simple 
because you know you look that, a couple 
of pages of the textbooks that is how it 
works. 
Make no sense to me. 
And I'm that kind of guy who wants to 
lift the hood up and see what's going on 
here. 
so for me, what turned me into a 
mathematician, was realizing that there 
was something powerful that I didn't 
understand. 
And it took me many years to understand 
it, and by the time I did, I was a 
mathematician. 
because once you've got it, it was funny, 
because most of the other kids in the 
class, and, and at the beginning, my 
teacher, said look. 
Here's the formula, if you differentiate 
x to the n, you get nx to the n minus 1. 
Just use the sucker, and get the problem 
solved. 
And I was that kid that kept saying, yeah 
okay, but where did that formula come 
from, why does that formula work? 
And I was the only kid in the class, 
including the teacher, actually, who 
really worried about why that was the 
case. 
you know, that was clear, that was the 
point where I became a mathemetician. 
Because everybone else was content to 
just use it and get the answer. 
And for me, the fact that they could that 
without understanding it, is what made it 
interesting. 
because I wanted to know what Newton was 
thinking when he came up with that thing 
or what[UNKNOWN] was thinking. 
So I'll come back to that next week. 
It's really good question and it's a big 
answer and it's the that our modern, and 
we're doing big themes. 
We've already looked at numbers. 
What's the biggest invention that 
mathematicians have produced that changed 
the world? 
Hindu arabic numerals. 
That's fundamental to modern life for 
everybody. 
So that was the biggest one I would say. 
What's the next biggest one? 
Probably algebra, which is more efficient 
ways of dealing with numbers. 
And the next one's going to be calculus 
because that gives us, because the first 
one gives us all our commerce in our 
financial business, in our, you know, 
quantative stuff, money, began with 
money, as far as we know. 
All of that comes on from the numbers, 
and on the other side we've got calculus, 
that gives us all our modern science and 
technology. 
So these are big, big themes. 
okay. 
That was slightly more than a little 
digression, but I'll come back to 
calculus next time. 
Okay, shall we take a break now? 
Let's take a break now and then we'll 
come back, and we'll talk about how we 
[INAUDIBLE] count the votes in an 
election.
