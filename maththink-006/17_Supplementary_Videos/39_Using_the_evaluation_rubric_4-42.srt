1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,320
In this video, I'll show you a little
about using the course evaluation rubric.

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,880
The most common use of an evaluation
rubric is to achieve uniformity in

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,179
grades when a team of experts is grading a
large collection of examinations.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,880
The goal is to assign a reliable grade to
each candidate's work.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,230
In particular, it's assumed that the

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,340
people doing the evaluation are
experienced graders.

7
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:36,160
In this course, we are using a rubric in a
very different way.

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,070
Not to help experts produce a reliable
grade of a piece of work.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,550
But as a mechanism to help beginners learn
about proofs.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,250
If you look at the rubric for the course,
you'll see

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,296
that it asks you to consider five
different features of proofs.

12
00:00:54,296 --> 00:01:02,450
Logical correctness, clarity, opening,
stating the conclusion, and reasons.

13
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,540
I'll come to the sixth category later by
the way.

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,630
These are all important features of
proofs.

15
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,870
And for pedagogic reasons, are given equal
weight.

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,480
Here's why.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,080
As

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,420
I state repeatedly throughout the course,
proofs do much

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,860
more than simply establish that some
statement is true.

20
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,190
Actually, in practice, they don't really
do that.

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,560
They simply provide evidence that
convinces

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,130
a reasonable person with sufficient
background knowledge.

23
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,400
But let's leave that issue for now.

24
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,980
If you look at the role played by proofs
in

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,630
mathematics, you discover that just as
important as logical correctness,

26
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,230
is the understandability of the proof by
an intended reader.

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,065
In fact, in practical terms,
understandablity's

28
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,410
[LAUGH] more important than logical
correctness.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,990
There's probably no modern proof of more
than a few

30
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,980
pages that does not initially have a
logical flaw buried somewhere.

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,610
What makes proofs useful is as others can
not only detect errors.

32
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,250
But also have enough information to try to
correct them.

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,310
Proofs are as much about communication as
establishing truths.

34
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,300
Because we have to use simple examples to
develop

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,740
proof evaluation skills, in most of the
examples you

36
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,870
see, one or more of the rubric criteria
would

37
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,420
apply only in a simplistic way, if at all.

38
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,740
But in more complicated examples, they
will all be important.

39
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,830
That's why the five criteria carry equal
weights.

40
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,080
When you evaluate arguments, you should
view them in terms of

41
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,830
each of the five rubric criteria in turn,
on an equal footing.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,200
True, experts rarely use rubrics.

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,830
They are so familiar with the proof
concept, that they

44
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,540
automatically and holistically judge in
terms of all those perspectives.

45
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:58,270
For a beginner, the rubric breaks up the

46
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,420
task of judging the overall quality of a
proof.

47
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,250
To judging those five aspects in turn.

48
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,360
Each of those five is considerably simpler
to do than the entire task.

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,610
But you still find it difficult.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,010
After you've judged the proof in terms of
the five proof characteristics, the rubric

51
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,580
asks you to bring them all together to
produce a single grade for the proof.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,880
This is the number you would enter if your
task

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,350
were to assign a single numerical grade to
someone's proof.

54
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,670
It corresponds to the number an expert,
working without a rubric would assign.

55
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,430
The rubric is designed assist you, as a
beginner, to arrive at that final grade.

56
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,670
Incidentally, when you're evaluating the
work of another

57
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,890
student, as you would in test flight if
you

58
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,030
do it, you do owe it to that student to be
as fair and accurate as possible.

59
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,880
But no one expects accuracy from someone

60
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,710
who's just beginning to learn about
proofs.

61
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,700
Because everyone's work is evaluated by
three fellow students, all anonymously

62
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,840
by the way, with a reported grade computed
from those three grades

63
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,550
plus the individual's own self grade.

64
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,690
It turns out that most of the time, the
final grade is pretty good.

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,400
Nevertheless, the real purpose of the test

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,230
flight evaluation process is that it
offers tremendous

67
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,190
benefits to the evaluator in coming to a

68
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,290
better appreciation of what makes a good
proof.

69
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,940
In simple terms, in this course, the
grading is primarily for

70
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,180
the benefits of the grader.
