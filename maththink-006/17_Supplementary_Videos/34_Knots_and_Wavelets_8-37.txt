[MUSIC]. 
I live and breath mathematics. 
I'm aware of the fact that mathematics is 
been invented all the time. 
And yet, I meet people regularly at 
parties and elsewhere who say, well, you 
know, what's the interest in mathematics? 
Didn't the Greeks sort of finish that 
2,000 years ago? 
And you know, I think, oh my goodness, 
no. 
 >> Stanford University Mathematician 
Keith Devlin knows that there are many 
reasons to be excited about math, and the 
new ways math is being used today, 
something called knot theory for example. 
 >> Knot theory actually begins in the 
middle of the nineteenth century and it's 
what the name suggests. 
It's the mathematical study of knots. 
The kind of knots you tie in a piece of 
string. 
And what distinguishes one knot from 
another knot is the pattern whereby you 
wrap the string around itself. 
But then, in the 1980s, biologists 
started to team up with mathematicians, 
not to think about the kind of knots that 
tie them that we can tie in pieces of 
string. 
But to look at the knots in which our own 
DNA wraps itself, when it gets inside the 
cell, when it, when it lives inside the 
cell, and what a virus does to, to, to 
sort of manipulate that knot pattern. 
And so, it, it's, it's close to the stage 
now where peoples' lives will be saved 
because mathematicians who know about 
knot theory have teamed up with 
biologists to look at the fundamental. 
Maybe, maybe some of the most fundamental 
knots that there are, the knots that are 
right down inside our own cells. 
 >> Devlin spreads the word while 
wearing many hats. 
Math professor, radio personality, 
television content adviser, author, and 
lecturer. 
 >> I've already mentioned the iPod 
designed just down the road here in sunny 
Cupertino. 
well, those guys are geeks, down the 
road. 
They are the kind of geeks that 
understand this kind of stuff. 
So the Fourier's theory that's part of 
the mathematics, behind what's going on 
in the you know, and you know, and these 
guys now, you, you've got 60 gigabyte 
memories in some of these things. 
That's enormous amount of storage. 
You can store movies in some, not this 
one, but a bigger one, you can store 
movies in some of these. 
That's because of very, very effective 
compression techniques. 
What these things store isn't music or 
videos, it's numbers, billions and 
billions of numbers. 
 >> When you're listening to your 
favorite song, it's easy to forget that 
math is behind what makes digital music 
devices and similar technology work. 
But just what specific mathematical 
innovation makes this great escape 
possible? 
An important one is wavelet theory, 
another form of new math. 
 >> A wavelet is a very, very simple 
short little wave that will consist of 
maybe one little blip or just a couple of 
blips that can be described by a simple 
mathematical formula. 
 >> If this doesn't look simple, it's 
because simplicity is relative. 
Equations for curves can be much more 
complex. 
 >> Wavelets were first discovered, or 
invented if you like, early in the 
twentieth century. 
But it was only in the 1980s or 90s that 
mathematicians began to develop methods 
for dealing with wavelets that allows us 
to take these days, a sound wave, it 
could be a rock group or a two hundred 
piece orchestra. 
And reduce them to a mathematical 
combination of these little individual 
wavelets as they're called, which are 
little pieces of waves that don't keep 
going on forever. 
Actually, what's happening is you're 
hearing music that's been created right 
there, especially for you. 
Because what's stored inside the device 
Is instructions, it's an instruction set 
to recreate that music. 
That instruction set is written in the 
language of mathematics, because the 
information that's stored in order to 
recreate the music is actually hundreds, 
thousands, maybe millions and billions of 
numbers. 
One way to think about wavelets and how 
they're used is to think in terms of 
building a house. 
If I were to give you, say five or six 
different kinds of bricks, then you know 
and I know that you could go and find an 
architect who could use those [UNKNOWN] 
different types of bricks to build houses 
of all sizes and all shapes, because it's 
all a matter of how you put those bricks 
together. 
Wavelet theory is essentially the same. 
It shows you how you can take any sound 
wave or any video signal, any, any image, 
and how you can build it up from 
individual little building blocks. 
In this case, the building blocks are 
little graphical waves. 
 >> [MUSIC] And although, wavelet theory 
was developed only decades ago, a short 
time in the history of mathematics ideas, 
it was French mathematician Joseph 
Fourier who paved the way in the early 
1800s. 
 >> He showed that if you take any sound 
wave, actually any kind of wave 
whatsoever, you can split it up into 
component sine waves. 
A sine wave is the simple up down wave 
that you get when you hit a tuning fork. 
You can take any sound wave and split 
that up into individual components. 
You need a lot of them, hundreds or 
thousands of them. 
Actually, the mathematics says you need 
infinitely many of them. 
What Fourier assured, was that if you 
take a sound wave, a complicated wave 
like this one right on the top here, you 
can actually make that by taking very, 
very many sound waves. 
Like the one at the bottom of different 
amplitudes and frequencies, add them all 
together, and get the complicated sound 
wave that we see here. 
So, this complicated sound wave at the 
top can actually be built out of 
components, all of which looks like this 
one on the bottom. 
 >> It's like the sound of a choir. 
When you listen to many people singing 
together, you hear a group of voices in 
unison. 
In effect, a single sound. 
Of course, what you're listening to is 
not just a single sound, it's made up of 
dozens of voices. 
If you are able to hear each of these 
singers separately, you could pick out 
one person's voice. 
The unified sound illustrates the basis 
of Fourier's theory. 
 >> [MUSIC] Another way to get a handle 
on Fourier's theory is to use the tuning 
fork. 
We'll hit the tuning fork, and if you 
look on the oscilloscope screen, what 
you're getting is an image, a visual 
image of the sound. 
And because it's a turning fork making a 
pure sound, a pure note, what we're 
seeing is a sine curve. 
If we were to take a whole bunch of 
tuning forks and put them together, then 
we would be able to create any sound we 
wanted to if we did it the right way. 
For example, if I take another tuning 
fork and I hit the tuning fork, it's a 
different size tuning fork, I'm getting a 
different sound. 
 >> If you look at the oscilloscope 
tracings from both turning forks 
together, you can see how the second wave 
looks like it's moving faster to the 
left. 
[MUSIC] This is due to its slightly 
greater frequency, but it's still a sine 
curve. 
 >> It's because the wave changes in its 
dimensions that when you put them 
together, when you put lots of them 
together, what results is not just one 
big sine curve. 
But actually, one very complicated curve 
with all sorts of different wiggles in 
it, that when you play it back could be 
indeed Beethoven's ninth symphony. 
 >> That's part of the basis for today's 
digital music players. 
But Fourier's discovery of how sine waves 
can be combined to make more complex 
waves has now been advanced into uses of 
the simpler little pieces of waves or 
wavelengths. 
Rather than going on and on endlessly, as 
a sign wave does, wavelets, or wave 
particles start and stop. 
Why is that important? 
Because the mathematical description of a 
sound wave in terms of sine waves is very 
cumbersome. 
Where as the description in terms of 
wavelets is much simpler and new 
applications for wavelets are always 
being developed. 
The FBI uses wavelets to help encode 
their fingerprint database. 
Wavelets are beginning to help with 
weather forecasting. 
Keith Devlin, like so many other 
mathematicians, is excited to know that 
new mathematics, like recently developed 
wavelet theory, are still being invented 
as our new connections between different 
types of math, and of course, the new 
high tech developments born out of all 
this. 
 >> mathematics is invented all the 
time. 
Most of the mathematical knowledge we 
have, over half the mathematical 
knowledge we have, was invented by 
mathematicians who were living today. 
Mathematics is an incredibly vibrant 
subject. 
I like it, I'm excited by it, and I want 
to, there's a natural human instinct to 
want to share your excitement with 
others. 
So when I, when I wrote my book on New 
Mathematics, it was an attempt to convey 
to others. 
First of all, that New Mathematics is 
happening all the time. 
And secondly, that it's exciting, cool 
stuff. 
And thirdly, and deliberately thirdly, 
it's important stuff that will in fact 
effect everyone's lives 20 or 30 years 
from now.
