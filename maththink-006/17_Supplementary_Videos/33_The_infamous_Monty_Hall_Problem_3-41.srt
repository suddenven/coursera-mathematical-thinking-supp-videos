Most of us encounter probabilities in 
games of chance. 

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,584
If a die is rolled a great many times, 
then on average the one will come up one 

4
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:23,595
sixth of the time. 
Its probability is one sixth. 

5
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:28,245
The basic mathematics of calculating 
probabilities was worked out by the 

6
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:34,245
French mathematicians Fermat and Pascal 
in the seventeenth century. 

7
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:38,950
Bayes added an intriguing new twist to 
that theory. 

8
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,610
He showed how what you already know can 
change the odds.

 >> Each week, at a particular moment in 

17

contestant to guess which of the three 

18
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:22,942
doors concealed a prize[CROSSTALK]. 
 >> Door Number 2, Door Number 3, which 

19
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:26,855
one would you like? 
 >> Let's say you choose Door 1. 

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,925
You have a one third probability of 
winning. 

21
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:34,150
And that's exactly the same for the other 
two doors. 

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:39,410
Here's where it gets interesting. 
Monty Hall doesn't let you open your 

23
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,722
door. 
Instead, he opens of the other two doors. 

24
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:50,550
Say, Door 3, revealing an empty space. 
Now, he asks you if you want to change 

25
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,138
your choice, from Door 1 to Door 2. 
So, what do you do? 

26
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:59,550
Do you stick with your original choice or 
do you switch? 

27
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,408
If you think it makes no difference, then 
you're wrong. 

28
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:08,060
If you switch, it actually doubles your 
chance of being right. 

29
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,250
Here's why. 
When you choose Door 1, the probability 

30
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,579
the prize is behind it, is one third. 
That means the chance that the prize is 

31
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:24,540
behind one of the other two doors is one 
third plus one third or two thirds. 

32
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,400
When Monte Hall eliminates Door 3, those 
odds pass to Door 2 alone. 

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,600
Thus, switching from Door 1 to Door 2 
doubles your chances of winning.

 >> Bayes would have had no problem 

37
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:49,300
explaining what's happened. 
It's all to do with prior information. 

38
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,080
Because the host knows which door has the 
prize behind it, and opens one that 

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,701
doesn't, this knowledge changes the odds.

Not convinced? 
[MUSIC]. 

41
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:03,550
Well try the puzzle again with a 100 
doors. 

42
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,840
Let's say you choose door 33. 
Now, the host opens all the remaining 

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,099
doors except one. 
Would you still stick or would you 

44
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,518
switch? 
The chance of your guess being right is 

45
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:20,845
only 1 in a 100. 
But as Bayes would tell you, the host's 

46
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:27,517
knowledge has changed the odds for the 
remaining door to 99 hundreths. 

47
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:32,370
It's tricky, isn't it? 
What this shows is that it can be hard 

48
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,810
figuring the odds when someone has prior 
knowledge.
