1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,840
Welcome back, and there's two topics 
tonight, the first is the one I began in 

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,900
just sort of got into a little bit at the 
beginning, at the end of last time. 

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,40
And so, I'll pick up on that, actually 
think about the birth of algebra. 

4
00:00:17,40 --> 00:00:19,790
Which is part of a general sort of 
historical theme that's going to be 

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,666
running through this. 
But I'm also into sparsing it with sort 

6
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:28,557
of more up to date things, and given the 
events in the political arena, the second 

7
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:32,994
half is going to be about how do we count 
the votes in a general election. 

8
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:34,980
Okay? 
And the spoiler is you tell me who you 

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,452
want to win and I can give you a fair way 
to count the votes so that person will 

10
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:38,761
win. 

11
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,761
 >> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] . 

12
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:40,947
 >> Okay? 
So, you know? 

13
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:41,834
 >> [INAUDIBLE] 

14
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,880
 >> It's, it's not who wins, well actually, 

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,724
it could be who wins the debate that can 
really get into the White House, but 

16
00:00:47,724 --> 00:00:51,382
really the game is won or lost when you 
decide how you're going to count the 

17
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:54,160
votes. 
So that would be the second half. 

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,520
Okay, I'll go a little bit, I'll go 
fairly quickly for the first couple of 

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,104
minutes, because we, we got into this 
last time, and this is about the birth of 

20
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:03,702
algebra. 
And I pointed out that we need to be 

21
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:07,225
careful what we mean by algebra. 
In fact, even today, there were two 

22
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:10,346
meanings. 
There's what I'd called sophisticated, or 

23
00:01:10,346 --> 00:01:14,250
aritmatical thinking, or meta 
arithmetical thinking, which is the, the 

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,240
kind of, which is what most people think 
of as algebra. 

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,460
It's what's the basis of algebra in the 
high school system. 

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,90
And then there's what mathematicians call 
algebra, sometimes known as higher 

27
00:01:24,90 --> 00:01:25,162
algebra. 
[COUGH] Okay. 

28
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:30,986
Well first of all, and, and the focus 
mainly is going to be almost exclusively 

29
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:36,810
is on the former, which is algebra as it 
arose out of arithmetic as a, as a way of 

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,787
improving arithmetic calculations. 
So I'm not going to be touching on higher 

31
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:45,378
algebra, [SOUND] which is what is done, 
so if you say that, if you come, if you 

32
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:48,798
go around the, if you go around the 
Stanford campus, you're going to math 

33
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:52,503
department, and you go into an office and 
someone says this is professor X, and 

34
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:55,750
professor X is an algebraist, this is not 
what professor X does. 

35
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,570
Professor X does something very 
different. 

36
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,700
Perhaps works on something like Fermat's 
last theoroem. 

37
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,924
Although that turned out not to be 
algebraic in the end, but that's another 

38
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:07,591
story. 
Okay, certainly not algebra, because it 

39
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:11,201
uses symbols. 
In fact, algebra, for many years, was 

40
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:15,520
written, in a non symbolic fashion. 
It was always done symbolically. 

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,64
by the way, I will mention that, if you 
start going on the web, and you go to, 

42
00:02:20,64 --> 00:02:24,466
even to Wikipedia and you look for 
accounts on algebra, there's a lot of 

43
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:28,916
misinformation floating out there. 
That's one of the, Wikipedia's actually 

44
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:32,884
pretty good on a lot of mathematical 
content, but the last time I looked, in 

45
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:35,980
terms of the history of algebra, it was 
really very weak. 

46
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,536
Largely, because it was based on the few 
textbooks that were available, that 

47
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:45,160
people have access to, most of which are 
actually quite old, and scholarship has, 

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,530
has advanced quite a bit since then. 
[COUGH] Okay, so this is one of those 

49
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,850
instances where beware of what you find 
on the web. 

50
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,128
Okay, we certainly so, it, it's not 
because it's symbolic that makes it 

51
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:00,204
arguable, it's the kind of thinking 
that's going on. 

52
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:06,759
[COUGH] and in fact the symbolic part 
although you can trace it back to these 

53
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:13,314
fairly early origins it really wasn't 
until, even later than the 13th century, 

54
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:21,602
that that we get modern symbolic algebra. 
In fact 16 centuries when you can first 

55
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:27,191
really identify the work of Phan's Viete, 
Viete you can really recognize symbolic 

56
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:32,314
algebra in the modern sense. 
Okay, so, the key distinction is it's a 

57
00:03:32,314 --> 00:03:37,440
logical thinking rather than numerical 
quantity thinking. 

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,94
it's not calculating with numbers, it's 
reasoning logically about numbers. 

59
00:03:43,94 --> 00:03:49,269
so whereas arithmetic is definitely 
quantitative, algebra is very much a 

60
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,390
qualitative discipline. 
But it's focused on numbers, this kind of 

61
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:59,356
algebra is still focused on numbers. 
And one of the ways to distinguish it is 

62
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:03,388
where was in calculation, you have some 
data, and you do things to that data to 

63
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:06,100
get an answer. 
You can't get it with the data, you add 

64
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,300
numbers together, you multiply them, and 
it's a forward looking thing where you're 

65
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,49
combining things. 
You're, you're literally not getting new 

66
00:04:13,49 --> 00:04:16,20
information, you're combining information 
you've got. 

67
00:04:16,20 --> 00:04:19,780
In order to get a result that was already 
implicit in that data. 

68
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,30
one of the features of algebra, is it's a 
little bit different. 

69
00:04:24,30 --> 00:04:27,270
You know that there's an answer out 
there, you give it a name, and then you 

70
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,225
sort of almost work backwards. 
You reason what, would have to happen to 

71
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:34,794
get to that thing. 
So you reason, logically, in order to, to 

72
00:04:34,794 --> 00:04:39,367
determine that value. 
now it doesn't matter whether you call 

73
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:44,918
that unknown by a name, and in fact in 
medieval mathematics, it was used by 

74
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,530
terms that really meant the thing. 
You do this to the thing, you do that to 

75
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,200
the thing and then you find out that the 
thing is this. 

76
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,736
so there were various terms in Latin and 
other languages which really translate as 

77
00:04:56,736 --> 00:05:01,670
the thing. 
and it only became known as the x, 

78
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,790
solving for x, was more like 16, 17th 
century. 

79
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,368
So it's not to do with the language. 
And, you know, my knowledge with, with 

80
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:15,400
music, music is transcends the musical 
notation, and algebra transcends any 

81
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,784
particular notation. 
It's the way of thinking that that 

82
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,319
distinguishes it. 
[COUGH] So my, one of the things I 

83
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,639
mentioned last time was that, taking a 
formula and putting numbers in is 

84
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,679
outright arithmetic but the deriving of 
that formula in the first place usually 

85
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:34,490
involves qualitative, what we might call 
algebraic reasoning. 

86
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,577
And the examples I gave, again, last time 
very quickly was solving a quadratic by 

87
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:41,810
guessing and calculation. 
That just doing arithmetic, you make a 

88
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:47,138
guess and then you do some calculation. 
If you're systematic and you substitute 

89
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:53,526
in a formula, that's also arithmetic. 
But if you look at the the method whereby 

90
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:58,297
the formula itself is obtained. 
Or in the case of a particular example 

91
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:02,719
like this, looking at the structure of it 
and reasoning about it then that's 

92
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:06,940
really, I mean there's a, there's a fuzzy 
borderline, and some people might 

93
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,228
disagree with [UNKNOWN] classifying this 
as algebraic because it is a fuzzy 

94
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:14,161
borderline. 
But I would say when you start doing 

95
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:18,717
this, you've really crossed over into 
into algebraic thinking, lets say its 

96
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:23,1
fuzzy and and you know different people 
might want to put the borderline in a 

97
00:06:23,1 --> 00:06:29,144
different place. 
So I would say that's, that's, that's 

98
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:37,709
that's moved over and that's, that's, 
that's really algebra.
