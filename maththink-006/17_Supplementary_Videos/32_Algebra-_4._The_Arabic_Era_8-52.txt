Okay[COUGH]. 
Here's a very famous, a historically 
famous problem, from al-Khwarizmi's 
Algebra. 
This is how it was written. 
Doesn't look like algebra today but it's 
all language, all words. 
Let me give you, well actually, let me 
read it out. 
Because this was a, a, a modern 
translation, a fairly literal 
translation, from al-Khwarizmi's book. 
If some one say, you divide 10 into two 
parts, multiply the 1 by itself; it will 
be equal to the other taken 81 times. 
Computation; You say, 10 less thing 
that's going to be a 10 but it is less 
something. 
It's a diminish 10, multiplied by itself 
is a 100 plus a square less 20 things. 
So the less doesn't mean you're 
subtracting, it means it's reduced 
somehow and this is equal to 81 things. 
Separate the 20 things from a hundred and 
square and a square and add them to 81. 
It will then be a 100 plus a square, 
which is equal to a 101 roots. 
Halve the roots; the moiety and we'll 
come back to that in a minute, is 50 and 
a half. 
Multiply this by itself, it is 2550 and a 
quarter. 
Subtract from this 100 the remainder is 
2450 and a quarter. 
Extract the root from this, it is 49 and 
a half. 
Subtract this from the moiety of the 
roots, which is 50 and a half. 
There remains 1, and this is one of the 
two parts. 
most of us would find that quite 
challenging to to understand let me take 
you out of your misery[LAUGH] they were 
solving this. 
You've got a 10 slimmed down by an amount 
x, you're squaring it and you get 81. 
That's the solution to that. 
And actually if you follow that through 
that's just the, the sort of like the way 
we might solve the equation. 
I'm not going to go through the details, 
but it's sort of like the way you, you 
sort of follow that through and 
understand that what you would do. 
bearing in mind that they didn't have 
negatives, but they could move things 
from one side to the other. 
I'm going to move on,[LAUGH] I, you, it 
was really just, the, the, I, I didn't 
want you to spend a lot of time, just to 
show you that the way it was laid out 
much simpler, we would think, to just 
solve that equation because we reduced 
algebra to very much just symbolic 
manipulation. 
Well the point about solving that 
quadratic is you can do it without 
switching your brain on. 
Once you know the method, you can just 
grind the handle. 
It's very much algorithmic. 
Okay so that was al-Khwarizmi. 
I will mention that al-Khwarizmi, because 
he was describing procedures for doing 
arithmetic, especially in his first book. 
Well actually both books. 
Gave birth to the modern word algorithm. 
So the word algorithm for computation 
procedure is derived from al-Khwarizmi' . 
So he, he left the word with 2 words 
algorithm and algebra. 
Pretty, pretty significant. 
Okay, so that how al-Khwarizmi, and 
there's another nice picture for one of 
the books. 
Then the next major figure almost 
immediately afterwards was Abu Kamil a 
guy who wrote a, many books at least 10 
of which we know. 
did a whole bunch of things really 
dramatic individual, remarkable 
individual. 
he actually used that equation to solve, 
to calculate the side of a regular 
pentagon. 
some very remarkable piece of work.um, 
and the guy was so sort of amazing and 
obsessive one might say that in one case 
he looked at many, what is known as 
indeterminate problems, problems where 
there's not a unique solution but there 
are many solutions, and in one case he 
actually went through and found 2,005, 7, 
676 solutions. 
Hand calculation of all those many 
solutions. 
well you think, there were fewer 
distractions then, right? 
 >> Yes. 
 >> So, it was even so that's, that's pretty 
remarkable. 
the next major figure, and there were, 
there were a lot of people involved. 
This was a huge en, en, enterprise going 
on, I'm just mentioning some of the more 
famous people. 
And then we've got al-Karaji recognized 
that the sequence. 
Well that first remark is really a modern 
interpretation of what he did. 
You have to sort of read it with modern 
eyes, but essentially he realized that 
you can keep running up the exponents 
indefinitely. 
likewise from a modern perspective, he 
discovered proof by induction. 
The method of proof by induction where 
you prove the first case and then you're 
sure that if it's true for n it's true 
for n plus 1, for those of you who've 
been through that kind of an education. 
it's not explicit in his work but it's 
certainly implicit and some of the 
historians I talked to said that yeah 
it's a little bit of a stretch to call it 
induction. 
but from my perspective as a 
mathematician it was induction. 
it depends how you define it. 
I could certainly look at it and see 
induction. 
and he verified this which is typically 
done today by induction, that the sum of 
the first n cubed is that formula. 
I think I should add some, I think that 
problem is on the test, the problem sheet 
that I'm handing out to my student in my 
online class today. 
If it's not today, it's on Wednesday, so, 
don't tell them. 
[LAUGH] Right? 
I think, I think I'm asking them to prove 
this one as an example of induction 
proofs. 
he wrote at least three books. 
then there's the famous Omar Khayyam no 
more in the west as a poet I never 
thought his poetry was that good but his 
mathematics was brilliant and I think the 
fact he's known as a poet reflects more 
on our values in society where we value 
poetry over mathematics. 
I, I wouldn't change the balance the 
other way I'd say. 
I wouldn't want to put them on a battle, 
because they're both important things. 
okay yeah but he certainly did some 
spectacular mathematics, worked on 
astronomy, calendar reform, a very 
significant figure very, very detailed 
cataloguing of things. 
All the possible kinds of equations, 
relating them to geometric constructions. 
His, his book is, is easily available in 
at least three translations, including 
one as recent as last year. 
so if cubic's using very intricate 
instructions involving conic sections 
methods that are sometimes taught today 
in, in, in classes of fork or some kind 
of thing. 
and actually looked at the issue of 
things that could, could, couldn't be 
solved by ruler and compass methods. 
So was very much into the kind of things 
that are still. 
At least in high school geometry courses, 
still very much a focus. 
I know, a rather nice picture from this 
manuscript of the cubic equation in this 
section of conic section. 
Okay, and then this amazing person, did a 
whole bunch of things. 
certainly a child prodigy, he wrote over 
80 books and articles got involved in all 
sorts of other enterprises. 
al-Samaw'al. 
And this is really a sort of a quotation 
from, I mean, this is a quotation from 
one of his writings. 
He said that algebra involves quote, 
"Operating on unknowns using all the 
arithmetical tools, in the same way as 
the arithmetician operates on the known." 
That nails that distinction between 
algebra and, and arithmetic. 
You're using arithmetical tools but, 
you're doing it a different level of 
abstraction. 
You're doing it on the unknowns, which 
means you're sort of doing logical 
reasoning with them. 
You're doing qualitative reasoning in an 
arithmetic framework as opposed to 
calculating with the numbers. 
And he, among the things he did was true 
of this result for the sums of the 
squared. 
Again, that's expressing it in modern 
notation. 
So absent and notation you've got an 
awful lot of modern algebra been on this 
period. 
but the story then picks up by Leonardo 
and then if we're satisfied with Leonardo 
we can pick up essentially the same story 
in terms of spreading the word with Steve 
Jobs, so that was a quick tour through 
algebra, the history of algebra up to, 
essentially to modern times.
