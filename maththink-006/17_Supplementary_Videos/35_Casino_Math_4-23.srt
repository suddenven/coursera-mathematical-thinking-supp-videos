[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:24,748
This is the story of how a group of 
gamblers fleeced the casinos for 

3
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:27,205
millions. 
[NOISE] 

4
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:32,292
 >> The buzz for me was the potential. 
It was unlimited. 

5
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,950
And I could make money without punching a 
clock. 

6
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,560
I could have a ton of fun. 
Certainly women were going to love me. 

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,940
It was great. 
 >> I was excited about the idea of 

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,228
goading death with [UNKNOWN]. 
David and Goliath kind of situation. 

9
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:49,760
 >> And beating them. 
And them not even realizing we're beating 

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,480
them. 
 >> But these were no ordinary gamblers. 

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,008
They were brilliant students with an 
extraordinary secret, that meant they 

12
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:06,098
simply couldn't lose. 
But Thorp thought he could do better, 

13
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:12,577
because he'd realized there was something 
special about Blackjack. 

14
00:01:12,577 --> 00:01:16,620
The odds of winning worked in a different 
way to almost every other gambling game. 

15
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:40,797
[MUSIC] In terms of mathematical 
probability, gambling games work in one 

16
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:49,752
of two ways. 
In Russian roulette, a bullet is loaded 

17
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:54,147
into a barrel of six chambers. 
[MUSIC] [SOUND] Every time the barrel is 

18
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:58,330
spun, there's a one in six chance of 
firing the bullet. 

19
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,050
[MUSIC] 
 >> When you're playing Russian 

20
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:12,140
roulette, if you spin the chamber before 
you pull the trigger every time. 

21
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,835
[MUSIC] Then each pull of the trigger is 
an independent event. 

22
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:18,985
The gun has no memory. 
Spinning the chamber destroys all memory 

23
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:22,566
of what's happened before. 
 >> [MUSIC] In other words, spin the 

24
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:27,938
barrel every time and the probability of 
firing the bullet never changes. 

25
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,675
It's always one in six. 
[SOUND] But there's another way of 

26
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:41,815
playing Russian roulette, where you don't 
spin the barrel between shots but just 

27
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:48,701
keep on pulling the trigger. 
 >> If it doesn't go off, and you pull 

28
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:53,121
the trigger again, the second pull of the 
trigger is not an independent event, 

29
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:58,785
because the odds have changed of you 
getting an explosion. 

30
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:05,355
 >> Each time the trigger is pulled, the 
probability of firing the bullet falls. 

31
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:15,940
Initially, from one in six, right down to 
a dead certainty. 

32
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,434
The odds change because they are 
dependent on what has happened on the 

33
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:22,410
previous pull of the trigger. 
What Ed Thorp realized, was this 

34
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,460
dependence is exactly what happens in a 
game of Blackjack. 

35
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,030
And it's because of how the cards must be 
dealt. 

36
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:39,290
Critically in most casino games after 
each round the cards are always returned 

37
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:46,380
to the deck so they can be played in the 
next hand. 

38
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,860
But in Blackjack, used cards are not 
returned, but set aside. 

39
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,347
This means the odds of getting winning 
cards change as the game progresses, 

40
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:03,179
because the deck is made up of fewer and 
fewer cards for every hand. 

41
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,350
 >> The thing that makes Blackjack 
different is each hand is not an 

42
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,430
independent event, the cards actually do 
have a memory of the previous hands and a 

43
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,880
good player can also have a memory of 
those previous hands.

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:17,880
