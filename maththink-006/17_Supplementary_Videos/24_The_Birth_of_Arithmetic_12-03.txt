Now let's look at the beginnings of what 
led to modern mathematics and arithmetic, 
with numbers, addition, multiplication, 
subtraction. 
I'm, I'm going to guess some kind of 
division came in. 
originally just addition and subtraction. 
The best evidence we have about how ari, 
remember that I mentioned counting goes 
back thousands of years, maybe 35,000 
BCE, maybe longer, using piles of pebbles 
probably, certainly notches on bones, 
probably notches on sticks. 
And the notched bones have been found. 
You have to interpret what they were used 
for. 
All sorts of theories out there, seasons 
and phases of the moon, and things like 
that. 
My guess is the one that doesn't get 
mentioned is probably the one that was 
the most significant, which is probably 
was the early monetary system. 
And I say that because the first real 
evidence we have for abstract numbers, 
was money. 
Why do we have numbers? 
It was money folks. 
You want to find new, you want to find 
out where numbers came from, follow the 
money[LAUGH]. 
go back to Sumeria and the fertile 
crescent region what's now mainly Iraq, 
and this was about 5,000 BCE. 
it, it was period that began then, but, 
but by 5,000 BCE is when we, we 
definitely have artifacts that we are 
pretty damn sure, we being the 
anthropologists, not me. 
What the anthropologists are pretty sure 
that what happened then was the invention 
of numbers and it was for monetary 
purposes. 
in other words, you need numbers to have 
money. 
Because num, money comes in numerical 
quantities. 
One of these, one of those, one of those, 
ten of these. 
the interesting thing is you didn't have 
numbers until you needed money, so the 
driving force was mediating human 
transactions of goods. 
[COUGH] And the essential reason why 
numbers came on was banking. 
Okay, it was essentially the invention of 
banking. 
It was the first bankers. 
Bankers were the people essentially who 
applied money as mediating quantities in 
trade. 
interesting how that has changed, I mean 
bankers now apply banking to figments of 
the imagination. 
 >> [LAUGH]. 
 >> But back then, it was too yeah. 
Back then it was to actual physical 
goods. 
But not quite. 
The vote set in immediately, because 
immediately you introduce money, you've 
got something fictitious whose value 
depends purely on, on human agreement. 
Okay, here was the evidence, and it was 
discovered in Iraq by Denise 
Schmandt-Besserat, who I think is now 
professor Emeritus at the University of 
Texas at Austin. 
She was here on the Sloan Center on the 
hill for a year many years ago. 
but now she was a young anthropologist 
going out into the fertile crescent 
region. 
And all over the place she kept finding 
these burial sites and these, these ruins 
of homes and things in which there were 
piles of clay tokens. 
Sometimes grouped together in, in ways 
that suggested some kind of an order. 
And they were different shapes. 
some of them looked, recognize but that 
looks like it might be an oil jar, it 
looks like it could be a goose. 
some of them, one of them somewhere looks 
as it could be a mill for grinding corn 
or something. 
Some of that looks[INAUDIBLE] some kind 
of a pepper corn. 
So these look as though they might have 
been tokens. 
For things that people would trade. 
Jars of oils, bales of hay, geese, oxen, 
loaves of bread, and so forth. 
So, the suspicion was, that these were 
probably tokens to represent your goods. 
If you had 5 geese to sell, you maybe had 
5 of these tokens to represent them. 
So the, the supposition was, and this is 
a reasonable supposition because the 
Sumerian society was pretty complex. 
It was getting to be like a modern 
society. 
There was structure in, in the society. 
You know, this was the drive, this was 
one of the centers of modern civilization 
coming along. 
And so the supposition she made was that 
these were tokens that represented goods. 
Okay. 
And here are some of them and so if you 
wanted to trade things you wouldn't 
necessarily have to worry, you would, you 
have so many sheep and things but may be 
the sheep be in the field but you have 
tokens that represented the sheep. 
So you would instead, so when you sh, you 
trade, you would swap your tokens for 
somebody else's oxen tokens, and then the 
goods would eventually trade. 
And so the tokens you had in your hand 
represented the things you owned. 
That was your bank account, and it was a 
collection of tokens. 
Not unlike a pocketful of change, huh? 
Those were the tokens, except there were 
different tokens for the different 
objects with different shapes. 
Okay, so the next thing you need is a way 
of keeping your tokens secure because 
that was a measure of your worth. 
And so bankers came along to look after 
your tokens for you, and what they would 
do is you would go along with it, and now 
we're just, I'm telling you the story 
that the anthropologists came up with to 
explain what was going on. 
The, you came, you went, you had your 
tokens, the banks kept your tokens, they 
would take a sheet of wet clay, put your 
tokens in the clay, fold it up, and seal 
it, bake it in the sun, and there was 
your secure bank account. 
All nice and secure, locked away. 
Okay. 
Now the problem was, of course, if you 
want to trade, you had to break open the 
thing. 
Take out the things, change them, and 
reseal it. 
Good business to be in banking. 
Constant need for bankers to break open 
the shells and reseal them and put their 
stamp on them, okay. 
So already the bankers were there hanging 
on, taking our money in the process. 
There's 10% or whatever they would take, 
so then, 
Some entrepreneurial person came along 
and said, you know, it's fine if we crack 
open the thing when we're actually doing 
a trade. 
But if I'm just making a bid on 
something, I don't want to pay the banker 
to break this apart and put it together. 
If I want to just show my worth, why 
don't I before you seal up this thing 
take the tokens and press them on the 
outside, then put them in and seal it. 
So on the outside of the, of the, of the 
sealed envelope, the clay envelope you've 
got tokens, indentations of the tokens so 
you don't have to break it open to see 
how many tokens there are. 
You just need to look at the 
indentations. 
That's an advance, okay? 
Your worth, so if you, interesting areas 
of structuring. 
We've now got real sheep and real geese, 
and real jars of oil represented by 
artifacts, tokens. 
Tokens are then put into a clay envelope 
and the tokens are now represented by 
marks on the outside. 
We're about to invent writing. 
Writing by the, for those people who like 
to think that mathematics is supreme, as 
far as we know, writing numbers came 
before writing words. 
Right, it all began with numbers, and it 
was all about money. 
So, they put these tokens out, so you've 
got abstract markers, symbols, 
representing the token, the tokens 
represent the objects. 
So, you're already two steps removed from 
the real world, and you've got these, 
these tokens. 
And that was fine for a while, and then 
after, you know, and then 1,000 years 
goes by, and then another entrepreneurial 
person comes along and says, you know? 
We don't really need those tokens inside, 
all you need is 1 token for each kind of 
object. 
Because you can use the same, same jar of 
oil token, three times, if you've got 3 
jar's of oil. 
So you just need different tokens to make 
these indentations. 
But it doesn't matter where these tokens 
are. 
It's really about the indentations. 
The tokens don't matter their just like 
the golden fort knox you know, you and I 
don't swap the golden fort knox it's just 
there alright, you just go with the 
tokens. 
So, when you do that you can think well 
in that case I don't really need a clay 
envelope I can just have a tablet. 
With marks on it, and here is one of the 
tablets. 
So these came later, flat tablets with 
the different indentations representing 
in different areas. 
You know, there would be different things 
they're representing. 
it could well be that the stock of the 
tokens in different boxes represented 
different kinds of things. 
This was presumably some code, but it got 
sophisticated and we have abstract 
markings on a piece of clay that 
represents your net worth. 
And if that doesn't look familiar, it 
ought to. 
 >> [LAUGH]. 
 >> 5,000 BCE, we got credit cards,[LAUGH] 
made out of clay. 
Okay okay. 
That according to the anthropologists. 
This has been sort of, this is pretty 
well accepted in, in the business. 
Their business, not my business. 
I'm, I'm, I'm happy with this. 
It seems like a good explanation is where 
we, we have money. 
Certainly, numbers came out of that area. 
And this, this, this seems the most 
plausible explanation given the available 
evidence. 
Okay so that's where we get counting 
numbers, it was for money. 
But there was another system of numbers. 
What about the numbers that are used for 
building pyramids, measuring volumes of 
things seeing how much land you owe, you 
own when the Nile delta, this is the Nile 
Delta. 
When the Nile Delta floods and you have 
to remap the thing? 
there was measurement. 
That was going on as well. 
And one of the interesting things about 
this is to, to modern eyes, those are 
both systems of numbers. 
Those give you the natural numbers. 
And that gives you what we call the real 
numbers. 
This is a 19th century, eh, the 1930, 
20th century interpretation. 
These were not thought as numbers. 
They were quantities, lengths, volumes, 
interestingly not areas. 
Areas seem to be cognitively complicated. 
But lengths, and volumes and quantities, 
so these were regarded as essentially 
separate. 
The Greeks tried to combine them, and 
when they discovered that you couldn't, 
the famous discovery that the square root 
of 2 was irrational, they pushed them 
apart again, and, and they took that as 
meaning that you can't marry, marry these 
with those because of what they call the 
incommensurables. 
You simply couldn't use whole numbers to 
capture this. 
Only at the end of the 19th century, 2000 
years later, were mathematicians finally 
able to marry these things together, in a 
single number system called the real 
numbers. 
That's very, very recent, and this is 
part of why mathematics got interested in 
concepts and relationships because these 
guys took a lot of of building. 
But the reason it took a lot of building 
was cause of these were regarded as 
foundational, and yet these, from a 
cognitive point of view, these are both 
basic. 
Human beings have a cognition about 
quantities, discrete quantities. 
We, we can count things. 
We also have sense of lengths and 
volumes. 
We have a sense of continuous size. 
So the human cognitive system captures 
both and it just took mathematics a long 
time to marry those in a single system. 
If you read, read Newton's Principia 
where he talks about the calculus. 
He's not talking about numbers, he's 
talking about quantities. 
Calculus in Newton's terms. 
Calculus wasn't applied to numbers, it 
was applied to lengths and distances. 
we interpret it today in term's of 
numbers, but that's because we have a 
different conception of numbers.
