Okay, well the word model is It's usually 
not, a lot of things in mathematics. 
It's very often just means an equation or 
a set of equations where you take some 
feature of the world, something going on 
in the world and you represent it by a 
model. 
You know, it could be a graphic, it could 
be a network, whatever it is, it's some 
arithmetic, some algebraic, some 
mathematical representation of something 
in the world that you can solve. 
So you're modelling the world so these 
abstractions, in the course of building a 
model when you apply that model to the 
world, then very often, lead you to or 
involves developing algorithms. 
Algorithms are procedures for solving 
problems. 
Let me back up, I think them the crucial 
distinction is that the model is a 
representation of an aspect of the world. 
An algorithm is a procedure for doing 
things that allow you to make conclusions 
about the world. 
Very often an algorithm of wise is in a 
used in the context of a model. 
In fact arguably always this. 
You need a model that represents 
something in the world, and in that model 
you can apply algorithms to draw 
conclusions about the world. 
relative to that model, you can also do 
algebraic reasoning, which may or may not 
be algorithmic. 
Algorithmic means step one, step two, 
step three, step four, but not all 
mathematical reasoning is algorithmic. 
It can be just, i've no idea how to solve 
it, i've no idea how to solve it, i've no 
idea how to solve it, oh, I can solve it 
that way. 
It's insight, it's the ah-hah moment, and 
a lot of mathematics is like that. 
It's very much not algorithmic. 
often, mathematics preceeds by, no idea, 
no idea, no idea, oh, great idea. 
And then when you reflect on that idea 
you can get an algorithm so that all the 
people can do it. 
okay. 
So a classic example I guess would be 
solving the quadratic. 
It was a great idea, you can do it by 
turning it into a perfect square, 
completing the square and ancient method 
we all learn in high school or in middle 
school. 
And the first person who did that you 
know that's brilliant, we just say, wow, 
I just turn this into a real square, now 
actually, you could imagine that 
happening if you're thinking 
geometrically actually. 
But the moment that person did that, you 
can turn it into the formula for the 
quadratic. 
And then you just got an algorithm, you 
just plug in the values, x is minus b 
plus or minus the square root of b 
squared minus 4ac over 2a. 
There's the algorithm, that's the 
procedure. 
That came about as a result of a greater 
how moment. 
So, back to the question, models of how 
we start with the world, and represent 
them in mathematics, and then once we've 
got a model, once we've got the world 
captured, an aspect of the world captured 
in mathematics, we can apply algorithms, 
step by step procedures or we can apply 
algebraic reasoning or geometric 
reasoning to draw conclusions about the 
world. 
And that reasoning may be algorithmic or 
it may just be thinking relationally 
until you have an insight. 
Okay, I think I've got as close as I'm 
going to get on the spur of the moment, 
yeah.
