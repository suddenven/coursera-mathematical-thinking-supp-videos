1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,846
.
>> So Paul and Keith and I are together to

2
00:00:03,846 --> 00:00:08,469
discuss the reincarnation of the
mathematical course that's been online.

3
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:12,284
It's, it's, it's not a 1.2.
It's actually the introduction of

4
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:17,472
mathematical thinking, new and improved.
>> I would call it version 0.2.

5
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:20,485
>> Okay [laugh].
>> 0.1 was last September.

6
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:23,202
This is 0.2.
And we might meet, we might, we might

7
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:26,324
reach a better release version[LAUGH] in a
couple of years time.

8
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:29,503
Of course we're releasing it.
>> So is this a matter of your deciding to

9
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:33,215
change content, or is this, the changes
are more a response to learning about

10
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:36,319
MOOCs as you go along?
>> Partly, we're learning about, its the

11
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:39,958
same content in, in some sense.
It's partly learning about MOOCs, and it's

12
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:43,111
partly the feedback we got from the
students the first time around.

13
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:46,368
The, the, we got a lot of ideas for what
we thought, what we think might be

14
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,628
improvements.
We won't really know whether they're

15
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:50,630
improvements until we run them out and
test them.

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,798
>> Paul, what do you see as the big
difference here between teaching this same

17
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:57,142
content to a flesh and blood classroom
[LAUGH]with students in front of you?

18
00:00:57,142 --> 00:01:01,312
>> There's a lot of differences.
I think one of the biggest differences in

19
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:05,501
a MOOC is, is the, the need to plan ahead.
That in a normal classroom, you have a lot

20
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:09,637
of opportunity to kind of change what
you're doing dynamically in the moment.

21
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:13,801
Whereas, in a MOOC, you kind of have to
have everything set and ready to go before

22
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,873
the course even begins.
And that's where the second version, we

23
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:20,273
can make all these changes that we've, you
know, kind of thought up as we were going

24
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:22,428
the first time.
And it's like, oh, well, we can't put that

25
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:24,683
in right now[LAUGH] because the course is
already running.

26
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,937
But now we have a chance to put some of
those things in.

27
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:30,229
>> So, can you, can you give me an example
of one of the key changes you've made,

28
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:31,894
Keith?
>> One change, and this is the most

29
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:34,877
obvious one to the students, is last fall,
it was a seven week course.

30
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:38,328
This week, I've taken the same material
and spread it over ten weeks, because I

31
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:41,879
got a lot of feedback from students who
were clearly motivated, dedicated, were

32
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,799
doing fine, but they had lives to live.
They weren't full time students, and they

33
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,175
would say, look, but I got to week 5, and
I had to go on a business trip.

34
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,965
And there were two lectures in week 5.
If there had been one lecture in week 5, I

35
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:56,496
could have caught up at the end of the
week, but there were two lectures.

36
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,445
I had to drop out.
And so what I am doing is I am giving the

37
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:03,108
first two weeks over two lectures a week,
because it's very introductory.

38
00:02:03,108 --> 00:02:05,474
From week three onwards, there's only one
lecture a week.

39
00:02:05,474 --> 00:02:09,014
So someone who has to miss a couple of
days because they've got some commitments

40
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:12,264
will have time to catch up.
>> And that was born out by the, the some

41
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,927
of the survey data we collected.
The median age in the last course was in,

42
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,588
people in their mid 30s.
So it's not just, you know, high

43
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:21,856
schoolers, or early college students who
want to explore this area.

44
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:25,137
It's a, we have a lot of students who are,
you know, who are professionals who want

45
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:28,212
to come back and look at this kind of
stuff that maybe they, you know, had to

46
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:31,046
drop when they were in college or they
never got a chance to explore.

47
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:34,191
So, it's a very different kind of
population than traditional college.

48
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:37,653
>> It's almost counterintuitive that it
would take more weeks to do it, because

49
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:41,163
you figure, if it's an online course and
you have, you don't have to be there at 3

50
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:44,188
PM on Thursday, you have all day Thursday
to go check in there.

51
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:48,956
You would almost think it would go faster.
>>, The freedom in the scheduling.

52
00:02:48,956 --> 00:02:53,008
>> Not with this kind of a course, because
the, and I kept telling my students this.

53
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,121
I kept putting it out on my blogs and so
forth.

54
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:58,391
That the bit that they see on the video,
that bit that's actually online, that just

55
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:01,103
sets the stage.
Because learning mathematics at this level

56
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:04,613
involves a lot of thinking on your own and
a lot of talking with other people and

57
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:08,030
struggling to master material.
So you could maybe watch a 30 minute video

58
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,706
that I give.
It may take you two or three hours of

59
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:13,904
intense thinking, off and on, to make
sense of that thing.

60
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:17,352
So if, I describe my role as really, the
conductor of an orchestra.

61
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:21,128
You know, I, I decide which tune they're
going to play, I raise the baton, and I

62
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:24,292
leave them to work and I go off and have a
cup of coffee somewhere.

63
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,584
>> [laugh].
>> And then I come back later and see how

64
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:30,045
they're doing and checking in because it's
really for them to learn.

65
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:33,340
I'm not really teaching.
I'm just setting the stage so they can

66
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,335
learn.
So there's a lot of time they need to make

67
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:37,931
sense of what I manage to get through in,
in 30 minutes on video.

68
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:41,359
>> And it gives a little bit more
flexibility having the course be over 10

69
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,610
weeks, even for people who could do it
faster.

70
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,406
They can still kind of, I mean, they can
still work fairly quickly in that 10

71
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:47,021
weeks.
>> Mm-hm.

72
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,437
>> And then, I mean, one of the things
Keith says throughout the videos is, you

73
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:53,893
have to do this slowly, you have to take
your time, you have to think about.

74
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:58,239
So even the people who are getting it, and
who are going quickly can still benefit

75
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,954
from having that extra time, I think.
>> So having had your, your base in

76
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:06,327
physical, you know, right there,
education, what's been your biggest shock?

77
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:09,282
What's been your biggest lesson?
>> Oh wow.

78
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:13,907
There were lots of little shocks, I think.
The thing that comes to mind is actually

79
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:17,491
not a shock, because I expected it was
going to happen, but I was sort of

80
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:21,341
surprised when it really did.
You know, I love teaching one on one with

81
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,815
a student.
I love teaching students in groups of

82
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:25,042
maybe five to ten.
>> Mm-hm.

83
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:28,888
>> Bring it up to 20, I've never, I always
try to cut my classes at 20 when I get

84
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:31,778
physical classes.
I've taught classes of 250 and 300.

85
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:34,660
That's the worst possible, because there's
no contact.

86
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,780
It's just an audience.
They're basically just wallpaper around

87
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,620
the room, and they're all on Facebook at
the same time anyway.

88
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,329
>> [laugh].
>> So there's no contact.

89
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,335
You would think 65,000 students, even
worse.

90
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:49,951
It's not 65,000 students.
It's 65,000 individual students.

91
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:54,229
Teaching on a MOOC is one on one.
You have a student sitting next to you.

92
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:58,915
But if someone watches my class, you
occasionally see my face, but that's just

93
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:02,691
to make human contact.
Most of what you see, is that hand and a

94
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:05,709
piece of paper.
The way we record them is an overhead

95
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:10,065
camera on my desk at home, piece of paper,
talking to a student, that in my mind is

96
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:14,422
sitting next to me, in conversational
terms going through some mathematics.

97
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:18,687
Now, the student can't answer back in real
time, which is a big problem.

98
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:21,235
>> Yes.
>> And we can and people like Paul are

99
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:23,511
going to try and help me to compensate for
that.

100
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:26,985
But it's basically sitting next to the
professor and talking to the professor and

101
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:30,483
trying to understand what's going on.
In other words, in a MOOC, you're teaching

102
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,671
1 student.
>> And well, well, Paul, when you talk

103
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:36,673
about the logistics of that, I mean, when
you have a teacher who's actually online,

104
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:40,501
on that time, changing things or just
putting it up, does, isn't there a natural

105
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:44,213
advantage for the student who's likewise
online at exactly the same time and

106
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:47,983
doesn't have that delayed reaction of 10
hours later coming on and, and seeing

107
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:50,783
basically a canned lesson instead of a
live lesson?

108
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,529
>> Yeah, that's, that's an interesting
question.

109
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:57,421
I mean, I think that there's from the
video perspective, since the videos are

110
00:05:57,421 --> 00:06:01,018
all kind of prerecorded, I don't know if
there's too much of a difference.

111
00:06:01,018 --> 00:06:04,543
Certainly it, within the forums, there are
times where, like, Keith or I will be

112
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,995
logged into the forums.
>> Right.

113
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:09,334
>> And if somebody posts a question right
then that one of us can address, there

114
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:12,832
could be some advantage there.
But actually, I think our experience was

115
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:16,986
in the first course we actually, I think,
intentionally try to stay out of the

116
00:06:16,986 --> 00:06:21,140
forum, like, answering questions right
away, until there had been a fair amount

117
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,612
of discussion or if it felt like it had
gotten to a point that it was an

118
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:28,394
unproductive disagreement.
But there's actually so much value in, in

119
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:32,099
staying out of the way, and letting the
students discuss with each other in the

120
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,165
forums.
And our experience was, I mean you,

121
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:37,469
because people post in the forums and
there's going to be a response within ten

122
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:41,371
minutes, 15 minutes almost every time.
>> I'm expecting two kinds of people to

123
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:43,550
come.
I know there were a lot of people who took

124
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,452
the last course and had to bail.
And some who took the last course and

125
00:06:46,452 --> 00:06:49,488
finished, but didn't do as well as they
thought, who have already emailed me and

126
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:52,901
said that they're definitely coming back
and they'd, they'd like to try it again.

127
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:55,796
So I'm expecting those to come back, and,
and they will see some changes.

128
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:58,727
There have been some changes.
They would be unwise to be seduced by the

129
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:01,927
fact that things looked remarkably the
same in the first couple of weeks, because

130
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:05,018
they do change as we move on.
There's a difference in emphasis in the

131
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:09,080
way some of the material's presented and
some of the things I'm asking them to do.

132
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,558
And they'll realize that as they go
through it.

133
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:15,392
And for people who are doing it the first
time, you've got the benefit of the fact

134
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:17,554
that we have now learned from our
mistakes.

135
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:20,026
Last time, it's going to be better than
last time.

136
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:24,684
Last time I went in to it thinking, if we
don't totally fail, crash and burn, it's a

137
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:25,922
success.
>> [laugh].

138
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:28,349
>> Yes.
>> So by that measure, it was a success.

139
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:30,952
We've set ourselves a standard now.
It was okay last time.

140
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:34,284
It was, it was actually one of the most
successful courses that Coursera would put

141
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:36,519
on at the time.
It was the second highest grossing in

142
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,973
terms of students that they've had.
>> Not bad.

143
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:42,613
>> So it was, it was doing pretty well.
That, may be the math guy thing that

144
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,781
helped there.
But it, but it did pretty well.

145
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:48,350
But that set us a bar, and we now
definitely, I mean, I will be disappointed

146
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,575
if we don't exceed that bar.
>> An individual can feel so involved and

147
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:55,587
so personally invested that they would
literally contact the instructor and say

148
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:57,749
I'm coming back.
>> Oh, yeah, yeah.

149
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:01,274
Yeah, no, they I mean, and, and in a
sense, we set them up for doing that.

150
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:04,702
Because one of the things I tried to
convey was getting a sense of me as a

151
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:07,070
person.
You know, I actually appear on camera.

152
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,904
And I didn't have to.
I could have done it like Khan Academy,

153
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:13,461
where you never see the person involved.
I want them to get a sense of me.

154
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:16,605
Because mathematics is dry, abstract,
decontextualized.

155
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:19,243
I think you need a person to make contact
of, you know.

156
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:22,603
I was their friendly grandfather, or the
uncle or whatever it was.

157
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:24,588
I thought that was really important.
>> Mm-hm.

158
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,190
>> But if you watch what I'm doing, I'm
actually not teaching.

159
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,323
I'm not telling them any material.
I'm talking about the course.

160
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:33,587
I'm trying to motivate them.
I'm the coach, if you like, saying you

161
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:35,262
know, you can do this.
Keep at it.

162
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:39,447
And it was making human contact.
You know, I've recorded it in the studio

163
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:43,339
into camera, eye contact.
But that was all about making contact with

164
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:45,821
a human being.
The moment we start talking about

165
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:48,611
mathematics, I drop out and it was just my
hand there.

166
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,216
So, it was all about making that human
contact.

167
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:53,885
So not surprisingly, they did feel and
responded.

168
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:56,524
They feel they knew me.
That was a trick.

169
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:59,553
It's like everybody knows the news reader
on their favorite TV channel.

170
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:01,556
>> Right.
>> It's a member of the family, because

171
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:03,988
they're in your living room every night at
6 o'clock.

172
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:06,074
That's powerful.
>> That's wonderful.

173
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:09,048
>> I wanted to use that.
>> Yeah, that's, that's actually a high,

174
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,342
high compliment.
>> And for, I mean, for all of the emails

175
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,842
that you got telling, telling you people
would come back.

176
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:16,968
The posts, we did a survey at the end of
the course last time and I would say there

177
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:20,040
must have been hundreds and hundreds of
people in the post survey when, in the

178
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,419
free response.
Instead of giving feedback on the course

179
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:25,116
they said, oh, I'm sorry I didn't finish.
I'll, [laugh], I'm going to do it better

180
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:26,957
next time.
Like, I mean,it was, it was amazing that,

181
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:29,972
I mean, so many people wanted, I think
they felt that personal connection in such

182
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:31,258
a way that they're like.
>> Yeah.

183
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:33,619
>> They didn't want to let us down by not
finishing the course.

184
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,863
>> Yeah, yeah,these, that's what
education's about.

185
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:38,042
>> [laugh].
>> The teacher, you know, teachers don't

186
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,740
really teach.
What they do is they inspire students to

187
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,578
learn.
>> Mm-hm.

188
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:45,046
>> I don't think we can, I don't think I
can teach anybody anything.

189
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:48,572
The best I can hope is to inspire them to
learn, because learning is the active

190
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:49,721
thing.
>> Right.

191
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:53,096
>> What teaching is, in some sense except
inspiration.

192
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:55,346
And so, my, I, I see my role as to inspire
them.

193
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,233
And, in a sense, it's an easy one, because
I love the subject.

194
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:01,331
And I like to inspire people.
You know, there's, there's, you have to

195
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:02,768
fake a lot in the medium.
>> Right.

196
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,425
>> But what you're not faking is your love
of the subject.

197
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:08,955
>> Yeah, or you wouldn't be there.
>> And that you're going to be there.

198
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:12,011
So I was very gratified that they
contacted me, because it meant that much

199
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,681
had worked.
You know, the one thing I couldn't do,

200
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,567
which I love doing with real students, is
when they come into your office, as they

201
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,224
do all the time, when you talk to them.
That's missing.

202
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:23,270
>> Yeah.
>> For, for those of us giving them,

203
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,361
there's a lot of, of interesting upsides.
The big downside is you never get to know

204
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,858
the students.
>> Mh-hm.

205
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:32,524
>> You know, we wouldn't be in the
business if we didn't like getting to know

206
00:10:32,524 --> 00:10:34,126
students.
>> Absolutely.

207
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:37,354
>> Actually I've had some professors that
I'm a little bit suspicious about.

208
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:38,116
>> [laugh].
>> [laugh].

209
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:41,659
>> [laugh] But most of us love this thing.
>> There's one in every crowd.

210
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,644
[laugh] Well thanks guys.
>> Okay.

211
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,687
Thank you.
>> Abliged to.

212
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,190
.
