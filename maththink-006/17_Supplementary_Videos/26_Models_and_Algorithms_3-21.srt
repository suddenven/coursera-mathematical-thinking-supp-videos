algebraic expression, an algorithm and a

model? 

5
00:00:07,372 --> 00:00:10,961
 >> The difference between algebraic, what? 

6
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:12,125
 >> Expression. 

7
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:15,617
 >> Expression, an algorithm and a model. 

8
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:19,600
 >> And a model? 
Okay, well the word model is It's usually 

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,294
not, a lot of things in mathematics. 
It's very often just means an equation or 

10
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:28,584
a set of equations where you take some 
feature of the world, something going on 

11
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:31,30
in the world and you represent it by a 
model. 

12
00:00:31,30 --> 00:00:34,345
You know, it could be a graphic, it could 
be a network, whatever it is, it's some 

13
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:37,711
arithmetic, some algebraic, some 
mathematical representation of something 

14
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:42,235
in the world that you can solve. 
So you're modelling the world so these 

15
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:48,514
abstractions, in the course of building a 
model when you apply that model to the 

16
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:54,570
world, then very often, lead you to or 
involves developing algorithms. 

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,773
Algorithms are procedures for solving 
problems. 

18
00:00:56,773 --> 00:01:01,813
Let me back up, I think them the crucial 
distinction is that the model is a 

19
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:07,543
representation of an aspect of the world. 
An algorithm is a procedure for doing 

20
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:11,880
things that allow you to make conclusions 
about the world. 

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,490
Very often an algorithm of wise is in a 
used in the context of a model. 

22
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,690
In fact arguably always this. 
You need a model that represents 

23
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,350
something in the world, and in that model 
you can apply algorithms to draw 

24
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,472
conclusions about the world. 
relative to that model, you can also do 

25
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:32,37
algebraic reasoning, which may or may not 
be algorithmic. 

26
00:01:32,37 --> 00:01:35,877
Algorithmic means step one, step two, 
step three, step four, but not all 

27
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:40,452
mathematical reasoning is algorithmic. 
It can be just, i've no idea how to solve 

28
00:01:40,452 --> 00:01:44,925
it, i've no idea how to solve it, i've no 
idea how to solve it, oh, I can solve it 

29
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:47,580
that way. 
It's insight, it's the ah-hah moment, and 

30
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,366
a lot of mathematics is like that. 
It's very much not algorithmic. 

31
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:57,880
often, mathematics preceeds by, no idea, 
no idea, no idea, oh, great idea. 

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,408
And then when you reflect on that idea 
you can get an algorithm so that all the 

33
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:02,620
people can do it. 
okay. 

34
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,65
So a classic example I guess would be 
solving the quadratic. 

35
00:02:06,65 --> 00:02:09,761
It was a great idea, you can do it by 
turning it into a perfect square, 

36
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:14,183
completing the square and ancient method 
we all learn in high school or in middle 

37
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:16,980
school. 
And the first person who did that you 

38
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,412
know that's brilliant, we just say, wow, 
I just turn this into a real square, now 

39
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:23,168
actually, you could imagine that 
happening if you're thinking 

40
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:26,602
geometrically actually. 
But the moment that person did that, you 

41
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:29,140
can turn it into the formula for the 
quadratic. 

42
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,861
And then you just got an algorithm, you 
just plug in the values, x is minus b 

43
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,330
plus or minus the square root of b 
squared minus 4ac over 2a. 

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,198
There's the algorithm, that's the 
procedure. 

45
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:41,20
That came about as a result of a greater 
how moment. 

46
00:02:41,20 --> 00:02:45,436
So, back to the question, models of how 
we start with the world, and represent 

47
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:49,852
them in mathematics, and then once we've 
got a model, once we've got the world 

48
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:54,682
captured, an aspect of the world captured 
in mathematics, we can apply algorithms, 

49
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:58,891
step by step procedures or we can apply 
algebraic reasoning or geometric 

50
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:01,930
reasoning to draw conclusions about the 
world. 

51
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,195
And that reasoning may be algorithmic or 
it may just be thinking relationally 

52
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:11,228
until you have an insight. 
Okay, I think I've got as close as I'm 

53
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:13,775
going to get on the spur of the moment, 
yeah.
