And when we look back historically with 
the benefit of hindsight, we can see 
algebraic thinking going back a long way. 
It certainly wasn't symbolic algebra in 
the sense we have now, although let me 
nuance that, 'cause I've already referred 
to that implicitly. 
There's two issues. 
There's how did they record what they 
were doing, how did they write down on 
their tablets and whatever, their 
parchment. 
How did they write down algebra? 
Or arithmetic, for that matter? 
And then the other issue is, how did they 
do it? 
Well, they've always, it's always been 
done symbolically. 
It's hard to imagine how you can do it 
without some kind of scratching of some 
sort of abstract symbols. 
But when they wrote it down for many 
centuries it was written down in words. 
And I, I eluded to that last week in 
connection with, with the Leonardo 
Fibonacci although maybe it was two weeks 
ago. 
The when before the printing press when 
thins were written down they had to 
written down in a manner that allowed 
fairly reliable copying. 
And the writers knew that the scribes 
would be literary people that could 
probably get the words right, but they 
wouldn't necessarily understand the 
symbols. 
And you know, one matter, one symbol 
that's written wrongly can turn a correct 
result into an incorrect result, can turn 
something sensible into gibberish. 
So in order to be to give some guarantee 
that results will be preserved when when 
things are copied. 
most things are written in words and but 
the, but it was always done symbolically. 
So and one of the things you find on, on 
some websites is a distinction between 
rhetorical algebra and symbolic algebra. 
That's, that's, that's all missing the 
point. 
It wasn't that it was a different kind of 
algebra, it was just the distinction 
between how it was written and how it was 
done. 
[COUGH] . 
so we got the evidence of the Babylonians 
doing something that was essentially 
algebra. 
it was, it was very much calc in term of 
geometric problems. 
but some of these, in some way was very 
practical. 
Some of them were actually numerical 
problems that were couched in algebra in 
geometric terms. 
And some just seemed to be recreational. 
[COUGH] and even though they didn't have 
notational devices for talking about 
variables in general cases, they talked 
in terms of specific numbers. 
It was clear, just as we do with modern 
recipes very often, you know, take two 
cups of this and three cups of that. 
And you just as-, assume you can double 
or triple any of the units. 
it was clear that they applied in 
general. 
But it was with hindsight, this was 
algebraic thinking. 
okay and indeed to the degree of having 
an unknown, an unknown that you reason 
about. 
the unknown wasn't a li-, wasn't a 
number, it was with geometrics or the 
unknown was a line. 
That's algebra. 
We might want to call it geometric 
algebra, just to clear about it but again 
this is a modern term. 
They were just doing their stuff. 
they were just trying to solve problems 
and then in some cases, just to have a 
good time. 
and as mentioned a moment ago. 
Sometimes they would do this to solve 
arithmetic problems. 
That, that's a feature that we can see 
later on in the work of Omar Khayyam and 
so forth, that it was a geometric 
approach to essentially numeric problems. 
[COUGH] And here's one, I think I got as 
far as this last time this problem which 
I've translated from base-60 into modern 
decimal notation. 
And it's written in, in words. 
I added the second, the area of my two 
squares, and I put it in decimal 
notation, and expressed the problem, and 
then it gave a geometric solution of 
procedure, an algorthm if you like, an 
algorithm for solving it. 
in modern terms I expressed the area of 
my two squares x squared plus y squared, 
and the area, I did them together, is, it 
comes up, is 1525, and then another 
condition gives me that equation. 
So I got two equations, one quadratic, 
one linear, and you have to solve them. 
That's pretty sophisticated. 
it's pretty sophisticated in symbols but 
if you're thinking about it 
geometrically, I think most people today 
[COUGH] though we could easily solve that 
using algebraic pr-, procedures. 
geometrically that's I would find that a 
bit of a challenge geometrically. 
this kind of problem was solved all over 
the place. 
You, you get the Egyptians doing it in 
the rhind papyrus Chinese, these are 
famous works from history. 
And the early Greeks in Euclid's elements 
but in those cases it's, it would fall, I 
would say, and most historians I've 
consulted which is not a lot. 
But I've at least consulted modern 
historians would say that that's not 
really algebraic. 
yeah, I should, I'm drawing on so, when I 
wrote my book on Fibonacci the man of 
numbers, I consulted with three of the 
leading scholars, one Italian and two 
American, on Medieval period. 
Actually the, the, the pre-Medieval 
period, the sort of the, the 
Arabic-Persian Period in the 8th, 9th 
centuries. 
And and then they, the medieval period 
and this, I consulted with three of the 
best modern scholars on those areas, and 
I'm, I'm pulling on those guys for my 
information. 
Rather than none of them have written, 
books actually that's not quite true. 
one of them's written some books but not, 
none of the three have really written a 
lot about what they know. 
Not in the form of a book. 
So their, their knowledge hasn't really 
filtered on to the onto the internet, 
yet. 
Okay. 
And I think, yes, I think it would get as 
far as this. 
Whereas we would do a plus b squared is a 
squared plus 2a plus b squared, the 
Greeks and others would think of that 
geometrically in terms of actual areas. 
You know, we talk about x squared but at 
the, the word square indicates that its a 
square floating around. 
So a plus b squared that means its a 
square which transfer a plus b and you 
find that kind of thing, this kind of 
geometric reasoning rather than algebraic 
reasoning in all of those famous works. 
Then we get something that really is 
beginning to look like modern algebra 
absent the x's and the y's and the z's, 
which were not going to come till the 
16th century. 
And this is Diophantus who wrote this 
multi-volume book, Arithmetica. 
The word arithmetic is actually in the 
title. 
But this is really arithmetic done from a 
higher order perspective. 
it really was algebraic thinking. 
we can recognize it as algebra. 
Absent the symbols we can reco-, and 
there are, there are symbols, but they're 
not the, the familiar modern x, y's, and 
z's and so forth. 
but it was definite introducing an a, an 
unknown, and then reasoning logical 
solving equations and that was around 
152, 150 Current Era. 
so there were these letters, but that's, 
you know, it's not symbolic algebra in 
the modern sense, but it certainly is 
algebra. 
negative numbers we use, and he used 
these techniques that we'll see in a 
moment restoration and confrontation 
moving things from one side of an 
equation to another, eliminating like 
terms from both sides. 
And solved, use, used these methods to 
solve polynomials up to degree six. 
Okay, now let's, I don't think I got as 
far as this. 
I think this is where I stopped last 
time. 
Okay, so the, if we want to trace the 
historical thread now, beyond Deophantus, 
then we'll go into India, Brahmagupta 
around 600 Common Era. 
And he wrote this book which I am not 
even going to attempt to pronounce But it 
roughly means something like correctly 
established teachings of Brahma. 
that's to some disagreement exactly when 
zero appeared. 
But this is one of the, certainly one of 
the first clear appearances of zero, 
meaning that's there a discussion of the 
properties of zero. 
I know that you add zero to anything you 
don't change it. 
You multiply by zero, you get zero. 
But that kind of a discussion, very 
recognizable algebra. 
We gain absent more than x, y and z. 
Gloss. 
And then solutions of quadratic formula, 
including zero and negative numbers. 
So that's very well established. 
along 6, 600 or so of current year . 
Then the next huge step, and this is that 
path that I alluded to in connection with 
and actually where you begin down in 
India with the Hindu Arabic numerals. 
Then, the, the, the Arabic speaking, 
Persian speaking traders moving that up 
Towards North Africa, and then crossing 
the Mediterranean to Italy, and sort of a 
three seminal figures from a historical 
perspective. 
There's Brahmagupta and then there's 
al-Khwarizmi, and then there's Leonardo, 
you know. 
They, they were just three, and, and 
essentially what they did that was 
distinct was they each wrote a book that 
survived. 
if you want to change things, you can 
write, you can do all sorts of things but 
if you want to have a major effect on 
history it will be recognized writing a 
big book is, is of in a good way. 
we know you regard Euclid, is been the 
guy who arbitrated geometry. 
Its not clear that Euclid did any of the 
work with the origi-, they originated any 
of the work in his book, he probably did. 
But the real power for Euclid's elements 
is the way it was organized, made 
systematic, and made available to us and 
laid out in a nice way. 
and the same was true with al-Khwarizmi, 
what two very important books, and 
likewise with Leonardo. 
You clearly have to be very good to do 
that, but you, a lot of the work is 
collection. 
You know, that's why I ended up comparing 
Leonardo to Steve Jobs. 
He just make a really good job of 
collecting it and marketing it and making 
it accessible and that's how to influence 
the world.
