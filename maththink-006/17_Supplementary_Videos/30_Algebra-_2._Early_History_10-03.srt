1
00:00:00,5 --> 00:00:07,250
And when we look back historically with 
the benefit of hindsight, we can see 

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:13,398
algebraic thinking going back a long way. 
It certainly wasn't symbolic algebra in 

3
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:17,552
the sense we have now, although let me 
nuance that, 'cause I've already referred 

4
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:20,940
to that implicitly. 
There's two issues. 

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,474
There's how did they record what they 
were doing, how did they write down on 

6
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:26,780
their tablets and whatever, their 
parchment. 

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,470
How did they write down algebra? 
Or arithmetic, for that matter? 

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,740
And then the other issue is, how did they 
do it? 

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,219
Well, they've always, it's always been 
done symbolically. 

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,292
It's hard to imagine how you can do it 
without some kind of scratching of some 

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,483
sort of abstract symbols. 
But when they wrote it down for many 

12
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:49,382
centuries it was written down in words. 
And I, I eluded to that last week in 

13
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,217
connection with, with the Leonardo 
Fibonacci although maybe it was two weeks 

14
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:55,760
ago. 
The when before the printing press when 

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
thins were written down they had to 
written down in a manner that allowed 

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,800
fairly reliable copying. 
And the writers knew that the scribes 

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,520
would be literary people that could 
probably get the words right, but they 

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,60
wouldn't necessarily understand the 
symbols. 

19
00:01:10,60 --> 00:01:13,635
And you know, one matter, one symbol 
that's written wrongly can turn a correct 

20
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:17,390
result into an incorrect result, can turn 
something sensible into gibberish. 

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,979
So in order to be to give some guarantee 
that results will be preserved when when 

22
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,211
things are copied. 
most things are written in words and but 

23
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:32,261
the, but it was always done symbolically. 
So and one of the things you find on, on 

24
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:37,246
some websites is a distinction between 
rhetorical algebra and symbolic algebra. 

25
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:40,560
That's, that's, that's all missing the 
point. 

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,120
It wasn't that it was a different kind of 
algebra, it was just the distinction 

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,711
between how it was written and how it was 
done. 

28
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:48,710
[COUGH] . 
so we got the evidence of the Babylonians 

29
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,877
doing something that was essentially 
algebra. 

30
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:55,790
it was, it was very much calc in term of 
geometric problems. 

31
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,690
but some of these, in some way was very 
practical. 

32
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,395
Some of them were actually numerical 
problems that were couched in algebra in 

33
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:05,968
geometric terms. 
And some just seemed to be recreational. 

34
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:11,626
[COUGH] and even though they didn't have 
notational devices for talking about 

35
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:16,470
variables in general cases, they talked 
in terms of specific numbers. 

36
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,935
It was clear, just as we do with modern 
recipes very often, you know, take two 

37
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:24,36
cups of this and three cups of that. 
And you just as-, assume you can double 

38
00:02:24,36 --> 00:02:27,404
or triple any of the units. 
it was clear that they applied in 

39
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:30,513
general. 
But it was with hindsight, this was 

40
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:35,318
algebraic thinking. 
okay and indeed to the degree of having 

41
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:38,605
an unknown, an unknown that you reason 
about. 

42
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:43,937
the unknown wasn't a li-, wasn't a 
number, it was with geometrics or the 

43
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:48,230
unknown was a line. 
That's algebra. 

44
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,826
We might want to call it geometric 
algebra, just to clear about it but again 

45
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:54,910
this is a modern term. 
They were just doing their stuff. 

46
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,748
they were just trying to solve problems 
and then in some cases, just to have a 

47
00:02:57,748 --> 00:03:01,160
good time. 
and as mentioned a moment ago. 

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,440
Sometimes they would do this to solve 
arithmetic problems. 

49
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,994
That, that's a feature that we can see 
later on in the work of Omar Khayyam and 

50
00:03:09,994 --> 00:03:14,518
so forth, that it was a geometric 
approach to essentially numeric problems. 

51
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:21,121
[COUGH] And here's one, I think I got as 
far as this last time this problem which 

52
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:26,179
I've translated from base-60 into modern 
decimal notation. 

53
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:30,970
And it's written in, in words. 
I added the second, the area of my two 

54
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,33
squares, and I put it in decimal 
notation, and expressed the problem, and 

55
00:03:36,33 --> 00:03:41,179
then it gave a geometric solution of 
procedure, an algorthm if you like, an 

56
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:46,264
algorithm for solving it. 
in modern terms I expressed the area of 

57
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:51,742
my two squares x squared plus y squared, 
and the area, I did them together, is, it 

58
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:56,580
comes up, is 1525, and then another 
condition gives me that equation. 

59
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,100
So I got two equations, one quadratic, 
one linear, and you have to solve them. 

60
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,204
That's pretty sophisticated. 
it's pretty sophisticated in symbols but 

61
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:07,800
if you're thinking about it 
geometrically, I think most people today 

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,779
[COUGH] though we could easily solve that 
using algebraic pr-, procedures. 

63
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:16,110
geometrically that's I would find that a 
bit of a challenge geometrically. 

64
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:20,360
this kind of problem was solved all over 
the place. 

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,650
You, you get the Egyptians doing it in 
the rhind papyrus Chinese, these are 

66
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:30,12
famous works from history. 
And the early Greeks in Euclid's elements 

67
00:04:30,12 --> 00:04:35,304
but in those cases it's, it would fall, I 
would say, and most historians I've 

68
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:39,895
consulted which is not a lot. 
But I've at least consulted modern 

69
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:43,966
historians would say that that's not 
really algebraic. 

70
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:48,658
yeah, I should, I'm drawing on so, when I 
wrote my book on Fibonacci the man of 

71
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:53,10
numbers, I consulted with three of the 
leading scholars, one Italian and two 

72
00:04:53,10 --> 00:04:56,803
American, on Medieval period. 
Actually the, the, the pre-Medieval 

73
00:04:56,803 --> 00:05:00,378
period, the sort of the, the 
Arabic-Persian Period in the 8th, 9th 

74
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:03,437
centuries. 
And and then they, the medieval period 

75
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:07,859
and this, I consulted with three of the 
best modern scholars on those areas, and 

76
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:10,990
I'm, I'm pulling on those guys for my 
information. 

77
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,258
Rather than none of them have written, 
books actually that's not quite true. 

78
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:19,743
one of them's written some books but not, 
none of the three have really written a 

79
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,860
lot about what they know. 
Not in the form of a book. 

80
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,416
So their, their knowledge hasn't really 
filtered on to the onto the internet, 

81
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:27,864
yet. 
Okay. 

82
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:34,190
And I think, yes, I think it would get as 
far as this. 

83
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,850
Whereas we would do a plus b squared is a 
squared plus 2a plus b squared, the 

84
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,828
Greeks and others would think of that 
geometrically in terms of actual areas. 

85
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:45,788
You know, we talk about x squared but at 
the, the word square indicates that its a 

86
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:49,228
square floating around. 
So a plus b squared that means its a 

87
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:53,864
square which transfer a plus b and you 
find that kind of thing, this kind of 

88
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:59,329
geometric reasoning rather than algebraic 
reasoning in all of those famous works. 

89
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,625
Then we get something that really is 
beginning to look like modern algebra 

90
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,712
absent the x's and the y's and the z's, 
which were not going to come till the 

91
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:14,308
16th century. 
And this is Diophantus who wrote this 

92
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:19,358
multi-volume book, Arithmetica. 
The word arithmetic is actually in the 

93
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:22,792
title. 
But this is really arithmetic done from a 

94
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:27,734
higher order perspective. 
it really was algebraic thinking. 

95
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:32,110
we can recognize it as algebra. 
Absent the symbols we can reco-, and 

96
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,190
there are, there are symbols, but they're 
not the, the familiar modern x, y's, and 

97
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,494
z's and so forth. 
but it was definite introducing an a, an 

98
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:46,698
unknown, and then reasoning logical 
solving equations and that was around 

99
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:51,673
152, 150 Current Era. 
so there were these letters, but that's, 

100
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:56,650
you know, it's not symbolic algebra in 
the modern sense, but it certainly is 

101
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,573
algebra. 
negative numbers we use, and he used 

102
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:07,266
these techniques that we'll see in a 
moment restoration and confrontation 

103
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:13,86
moving things from one side of an 
equation to another, eliminating like 

104
00:07:13,86 --> 00:07:17,354
terms from both sides. 
And solved, use, used these methods to 

105
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:22,155
solve polynomials up to degree six. 
Okay, now let's, I don't think I got as 

106
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:25,775
far as this. 
I think this is where I stopped last 

107
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:28,533
time. 
Okay, so the, if we want to trace the 

108
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:34,77
historical thread now, beyond Deophantus, 
then we'll go into India, Brahmagupta 

109
00:07:34,77 --> 00:07:37,986
around 600 Common Era. 
And he wrote this book which I am not 

110
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:43,154
even going to attempt to pronounce But it 
roughly means something like correctly 

111
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:46,179
established teachings of Brahma. 
that's to some disagreement exactly when 

112
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:50,395
zero appeared. 
But this is one of the, certainly one of 

113
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:58,79
the first clear appearances of zero, 
meaning that's there a discussion of the 

114
00:07:58,79 --> 00:08:02,631
properties of zero. 
I know that you add zero to anything you 

115
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:05,340
don't change it. 
You multiply by zero, you get zero. 

116
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,520
But that kind of a discussion, very 
recognizable algebra. 

117
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,920
We gain absent more than x, y and z. 
Gloss. 

118
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,266
And then solutions of quadratic formula, 
including zero and negative numbers. 

119
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:26,530
So that's very well established. 
along 6, 600 or so of current year . 

120
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,885
Then the next huge step, and this is that 
path that I alluded to in connection with 

121
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:35,44
and actually where you begin down in 
India with the Hindu Arabic numerals. 

122
00:08:35,44 --> 00:08:41,140
Then, the, the, the Arabic speaking, 
Persian speaking traders moving that up 

123
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,580
Towards North Africa, and then crossing 
the Mediterranean to Italy, and sort of a 

124
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,290
three seminal figures from a historical 
perspective. 

125
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,730
There's Brahmagupta and then there's 
al-Khwarizmi, and then there's Leonardo, 

126
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,990
you know. 
They, they were just three, and, and 

127
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,338
essentially what they did that was 
distinct was they each wrote a book that 

128
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:04,430
survived. 
if you want to change things, you can 

129
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,142
write, you can do all sorts of things but 
if you want to have a major effect on 

130
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:13,564
history it will be recognized writing a 
big book is, is of in a good way. 

131
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:18,998
we know you regard Euclid, is been the 
guy who arbitrated geometry. 

132
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:22,750
Its not clear that Euclid did any of the 
work with the origi-, they originated any 

133
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,826
of the work in his book, he probably did. 
But the real power for Euclid's elements 

134
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:32,35
is the way it was organized, made 
systematic, and made available to us and 

135
00:09:32,35 --> 00:09:35,862
laid out in a nice way. 
and the same was true with al-Khwarizmi, 

136
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:39,240
what two very important books, and 
likewise with Leonardo. 

137
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,173
You clearly have to be very good to do 
that, but you, a lot of the work is 

138
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:48,540
collection. 
You know, that's why I ended up comparing 

139
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,862
Leonardo to Steve Jobs. 
He just make a really good job of 

140
00:09:53,862 --> 00:10:01,982
collecting it and marketing it and making 
it accessible and that's how to influence 

141
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:03,87
the world.
