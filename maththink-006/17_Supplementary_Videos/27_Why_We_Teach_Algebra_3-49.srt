00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:05,537
 >> There was an article several weeks ago or 
a month ago in the New York Times about 

2
00:00:05,537 --> 00:00:10,552
the great disservice done to our 
educational system by requiring high 

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,7
school students to. 

4
00:00:12,7 --> 00:00:14,628
 >> Oh, Hacker, that guy Hacker, yes. 
Can you comment on that[CROSSTALK]? 

5
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:16,676
 >> I already have in public, but[LAUGH] I 

6
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:19,770
could do it again. 
couple of things. 

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,270
If his article was about, the great 
disservice that's done to our kids by 

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,220
teaching them what we currently teach 
them in their high school algebra class, 

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm 100% on his side. 
But he didn't. 

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,500
He said, we shouldn't be teaching 
algebra. 

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,595
What he should have said is, we need to 
teach algebra, instead of that excuse 

12
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:40,0
that's taught in the schools for algebra. 
Yeah? 

13
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:42,950
I hope you're recording me, so[LAUGH] I'm 
going to get slaughtered by this. 

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,627
No It, it's, what's taught is not 
algebra. 

15
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:49,543
If you go back and look at what 
Al-Khwarizmi was talking about and say, 

16
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:52,130
this is algebra. 
This is clearly important. 

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,95
This is clearly powerful. 
This is valuable stuff, and you teach it 

18
00:00:56,95 --> 00:00:59,398
in the context. 
Then it makes sense and everyone can see 

19
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:02,826
the use of it. 
I guarantee, that the person who wrote 

20
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:08,221
that, and probably almost all students In 
the course of their everyday life or 

21
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:13,190
their recreational activities, use Excel 
spreadsheets to do things. 

22
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,290
Excel is an implementation in silicon of 
algebra. 

23
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,720
That's what it is. 
It's a, a spreadsheet is modern algebra. 

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,178
A modern implementation of algebra. 
So anyone who could, was, keeps track of 

25
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:29,850
sports scores, or runs, runs events, or 
keeps track of their finances using a 

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,570
spreadsheet, they are using algebra right 
there and then. 

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,848
So Hocka was saying, we don't need 
spreadsheets, and you don't need to know 

28
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,712
about them. 
That's what he was actually saying, but 

29
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:42,769
he didn't realize that. 
So, it's a matter of what he was getting 

30
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:47,233
at and he missed the point but if it was 
a matter of what's taught that's a 

31
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,360
different issue. 

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,4
 >> So, I mean I don't use spreadsheets that 
much but they seem more arithmetical than 

33
00:01:54,4 --> 00:01:54,838
algebraic. 

34
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:56,975
 >> Yeah in terms of the. 
No but. 

35
00:01:56,975 --> 00:02:01,380
That's right because the issue is and 
this is really why. 

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,396
it, it was sort of implicit in what the 
the, the traders were doing in 89th 

37
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:10,790
century, in, in the Muslim empire when 
they were doing the trading. 

38
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,150
What they're saying is, there were 
calculations which you have to apply 

39
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,580
again and again and again, and the 
numbers change. 

40
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,556
If you're trading, you're multiplying by 
an exchange rate, you're doing something, 

41
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:24,252
you're doing this, and it's the same 
calculation essentially, but the numbers 

42
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,680
change. 
So if you have a method that tells you 

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,416
how to do it for any numbers whatsoever, 
you're at the level of algebra. 

44
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,530
And then the spreadsheets, that's what 
spreadsheets do. 

45
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,830
The do arithmetic efficiently, so that 
you just change the numbers and then you 

46
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,30
just, literally now, you just sort of 
pull the cursor down and it does the same 

47
00:02:39,30 --> 00:02:42,876
calculation for all of them. 
So it's doing algebra but still the 

48
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:46,880
algebra in the sense of[INAUDIBLE] 
because it is applied to numbers. 

49
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,368
The focus is on calculation but it's 
general methods for solving problems that 

50
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:55,856
are all essentially alike and once you 
looking attempt to general methods your 

51
00:02:55,856 --> 00:03:00,140
level of algebra, which is why when I 
solved about Babylonians I said this is 

52
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,92
really algebra. 
They were writing down a formula, they 

53
00:03:04,92 --> 00:03:08,382
were writing down instructions for 
dealing with specific numbers but the way 

54
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:12,738
they were writing it, was saying take any 
number and do this and this and this and 

55
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:17,76
the moment you start seeing take any 
number your essentially doing algebra. 

56
00:03:17,76 --> 00:03:21,818
Fortunately the guy that worked in the 
New York Times know that you know this. 

57
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:27,187
I tend to avoid writing about something, 
publicly, that I don't really 

58
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:30,537
understand[LAUGH]. 
And, I think he overstepped the lines 

59
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:33,121
there. 
But if he'd said, what my kids are 

60
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:36,690
learning in the algebra class, hey, I'm 
on his side. 

61
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,985
But I think that means we should reform 
what's going on in the algebra class. 

62
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,372
