00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,370
Hello, I'm Keith Devlin.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,880
Welcome to this online course on
Mathematical Thinking.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,450
The goal of the course is to help you
develop a valuable mental ability.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,630
A powerful way of thinking that people
have developed to over 3000 years.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,230
What I want to do today, is get you ready
for the course,

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,550
and tell you a little bit about the way
the course will work.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm doing this because for most of you,
this will be a very

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,680
different perspective, on what mathematics
is.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,550
Apart from the final two lectures, there's

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,400
very little mathematical content in the
course.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,690
And you won't learn any new mathematical
procedures.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,740
But mathematical thinking is essential if
you want to make

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,440
the transition from high school math to
university level mathematics.

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,110
The quickest way to learn what
mathematical thinking

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,060
is, is to take a course like this.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,970
So, by the time we're finished, you should
know what it is.

17
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,430
But for now, let me give you an analogy.

18
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,920
If we compare mathematics with the
automotive

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,480
world, school math corresponds to learning
to drive.

20
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,600
In the automotive equivalent to college
mathematics, in

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,010
contrast, you will learn how a car works,

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,860
how to maintain and repair it.

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,310
And, if you pursue the subject far enough,
how to design and build your own car.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,680
The only prerequisite for the course is

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,000
completion or pending completion of high
school mathematics.

26
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,060
That means many people could take the
course and find it valuable.

27
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,670
In particular, a key feature of

28
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,830
mathematical thinking is thinking outside
the box.

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,010
In contrast, they key to success in high
school

30
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,490
math was to learn to think inside the box.

31
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,490
It's because

32
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,270
thinking outside the box is such a
valuable ability in

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,760
today's world, that this course could be
valuable to many people.

34
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,200
But my primary students is someone in
their

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,470
final year of high school, or their first

36
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,320
year at college or university, who's
thinking of

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,200
majoring in mathematics or a math
dependent subject.

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,470
If that's you, than you'll probably find
that transition

39
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,680
from high school mathematics to college
level pure abstract

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,860
mathematics difficult.

41
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,960
I certainly did, and so did most
mathematicians I know.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,100
Not because that mathematics gets harder.

43
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,390
Once you successfully made the transition,
I think you'll

44
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,560
agree that college math is in many ways
easier.

45
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,350
What causes the problem is the change in
emphasis.

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,080
At high school, the focus is primarily

47
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,690
on mastering procedures, to solve various
kinds

48
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,270
of problems.

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,240
That gives a subject very much the

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,050
flavor of a cookbook full of mathematical
recipes.

51
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,530
Thinking inside boxes.

52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,820
At University, the focus is on learning to
think a different way.

53
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,110
To think like a mathematician.
Thinking out side the box.

54
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,830
Well that's not true of all college math
courses.

55
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,020
Those designed for science and engineering
students

56
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,760
are often very much in the same vein

57
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,520
as the courses you had in high school.

58
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,240
It's the courses that form the bulk of the
mathematics major that are different.

59
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,140
But some of those courses are usually
required

60
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,320
for more advanced work in science and
engineering.

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,140
So if you're a student in those
disciplines you may

62
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,890
also find yourself faced with this
different kind of mathematics.

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,550
If you did well at math in school,

64
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,820
you probably got good at recognizing
different kinds

65
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,340
of problems.

66
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,910
So you could apply different techniques
you learned.

67
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,810
At university, you have to learn how to
approach a new problem.

68
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,210
One that doesn't quite fit any template
you're familiar with.

69
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,690
It comes down to leaning how to think
about a problem in a certain way.

70
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,980
The first key step, is learn to stop
looking

71
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,610
for a formula to apply, or a procedure to
follow.

72
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,370
Approaching a new problem by looking for a
template, or worked example in a

73
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,790
textbook or present it on YouTube and

74
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,240
then just changing the numbers often won't
worked.

75
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,940
Eh, sometimes it will.

76
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,420
So all that work you did at high school
won't go to waste.

77
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,840
But it isn't enough for many of your
college math courses.

78
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,660
If you can't solve the problem by looking
for a template to follow,

79
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,990
or a formula to plug some numbers into, or
a procedure to apply.

80
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,440
What do you do?

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,440
The answer is you think about the problem
a certain way.

82
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,720
Not the form of the problem.

83
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,140
That's probably what you were taught to do
at school, and it served you well there.

84
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,530
Rather, you have to look at what the
problem actually says.

85
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,560
Sounds as though

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,630
it ought to be easy, but most of

87
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,340
us initially find it extremely hard and
very frustrating.

88
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,500
It doesn't come quickly or easily.

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,280
You have to work at it.

90
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,500
You're going to have to accept going a lot
slower than you're used to.

91
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,450
Most of the time, you won't feel as though
you're making any progress.

92
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,830
Your goal has to be understanding, not
doing.

93
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,085
You should definitely try all the
exercises.

94
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:08,050
They're there to aid your understanding.

95
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,900
You should also work with others.

96
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,836
Few of us can master this crucial shift in
thinking on our own.

97
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:17,482
That part's crucial.

98
00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:20,130
A lot of what we'll be doing is not so
much focused

99
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,980
on right and wrong, but on learning how to
think about a problem.

100
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,940
Yeah, sure, at the end of the day,
solutions are right and wrong.

101
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,990
But usually, there are many

102
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,320
different right answers, or different ways
to the right answer, and many wrong ones.

103
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,480
When you're learning how to think
mathematically, it's how

104
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,890
and why you got something right or wrong
that's important.

105
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,440
The only way to find that out, to find out
how well you're

106
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,200
doing is for somebody else to look at your
attempt and critique your work.

107
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,570
It's not possible to automate the grading
process.

108
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,330
Maybe one day artificial intelligence will
have advanced far enough for

109
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,550
a course like this to be automated, though
frankly, I doubt it.

110
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,570
But right now, you need feedback from
other people.

111
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,050
For a regular class here at Stanford, the
professor an

112
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,020
the graduate student TA's, grade students
work, an provide feedback.

113
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,500
With an open online

114
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,430
course like this, where there are

115
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,530
many thousands of students, that's not
possible.

116
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,500
So we have to go about things a different
way.

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,670
I've designed the course so that the
benefit comes primarily

118
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,127
from doing the work and discussing it with
other students.

119
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,520
Getting it right is important in
mathematics, but in a Massively Open

120
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,970
Online Course, a MOOC, like this, there's
no way to guarantee that.

121
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,840
Incidentally, not being sure if we are
right until others

122
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,720
have seen our work, is very familiar, to
we mathematicians.

123
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,900
Even very famous mathematicians, have had
the experience, of

124
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,460
thinking they've solved a problem, and
writing it, writing it

125
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,320
up, writing out their solution and sending
it off for

126
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,140
publication, only for an anonymous referee
to find an error.

127
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,040
In mathematics, there is such a thing as
right

128
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,190
and wrong, but deciding between them can
be very difficult.

129
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,540
So even the professionals have to live
with

130
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,140
never being sure whether they're right or
not.

131
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,770
Part of this introductory session is a
reading assignment.

132
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,280
It gives you a bit of a history that
should

133
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,114
explain why today's mathematics students
need a course such as this.

134
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,650
In lecture one, there'll be a short quiz
on the reading.

135
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,290
Let me say a few words about the quizzes.

136
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,280
If you were in one of my regular physical
classes, I'd talk with

137
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,594
you to find out if you had understood the
materials sufficiently to progress.

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,250
But with a Massively Open Online Course, a
MOOC, that's not possible.

139
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,400
You have to monitor yourself.

140
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,640
The quizzes are one way to help you do
that.

141
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,200
I'll say a little bit more about the
quizzes later.

142
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,870
But before you start lecture one, please
read a file called Background Reading.

143
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,380
It's just over six pages long.

144
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,300
It's a PDF file, so you can download it
and read it offline.

145
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,120
Well, now you know what an intellectual
quiz looks like.

146
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,760
The next thing I suggest you do is view

147
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,660
the video, finding your way around the
course website.

148
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,790
It will point you to some particularly
important

149
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,520
things to check out before you start the
course.
