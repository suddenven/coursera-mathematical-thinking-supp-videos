1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,840
Before you start the course proper,

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,730
you should spend some time
finding out where on the website.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,690
There's a lot of information there,
but it does take some getting used to,

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,510
particularly if this is your
first course over Mooc.

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,920
Let me start with the homepage,
that's the page behind me.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,400
This is the one you saw when you first
logged onto the actual course site.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,910
The homepage is where you should look
first every time you logon to the site,

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,750
because that's where I post reminders,
updates and other important information.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,120
Now, let's look at the main navigation
bar on the left hand side of the screen.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,880
As you'll see,
it's divided into four sections.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,280
The first section has just two links, both
to important course information pages.

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,360
At the top, there's a link
to the daily bulletin board.

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,040
The main content of the site's homepage,
you can see behind me.

14
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,020
Below that is the cost time table.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,030
A PDF file, I recommend you print off and
keep with you.

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,360
It lists all the key deadlines,
so you can plan ahead.

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,740
If I have to change
anything in the schedule,

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,055
I'll post a bulletin board
message on the site's homepage.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,530
By the way, don't try to print off
PDF files from your web browser.

20
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,750
Browsers don't always
display PDF files well.

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,390
In particular,
they can miss mathematical symbols.

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,740
Always download the file and
print it off using Adobe Reader.

23
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,960
Below those two links
is the second section,

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,775
which lists the parts of the website
where you actually do things.

25
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:46,349
Discussion forums, videos,

26
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:51,290
problem sets,
in lecture quiz duplicates, and

27
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,090
finally the test flight process,
which we can largely ignore for now.

28
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,189
The video section is where,
in addition to the videos themselves,

29
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,319
you'll find links to the assignment
sheets that accompany each lecture and

30
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,336
to PDF versions of the problem sets.

31
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,671
I'll say a little bit about what
those terms, problem set and

32
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:12,060
assignment mean in a minute.

33
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,770
Below the course activities,
is a section called Course Information.

34
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,410
Before you start work on the course,
you should look through the first

35
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,210
four items in this section, as well as
the last one on the grading policy.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,890
The first two describe the nature of
the course and how it's structured.

37
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,610
The first few times I gave this course,

38
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,310
some students felt bewildered by
the way the course progressed.

39
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,440
Mostly, they ran into difficulties because
they haven't paid attention to those two

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,550
course information sections.

41
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,350
Though I have since reworded them to
try and make things a bit clearer.

42
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,620
The course goals page is fairly long, but

43
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,710
provides some fairly important
background information about the course.

44
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,500
In particular,
it tells you what to expect and why.

45
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,940
If you're taking the course for

46
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,679
a certificate, you have two options,
the basic course and the extended course.

47
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,040
If you complete the basic course,

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,400
which lasts eight weeks, you'll
receive statement of accomplishment.

49
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,520
If you continue for two further weeks and
complete all parts of the test flight

50
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,340
process, you'll receive a statement
of accomplishment with distinction.

51
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,510
You don't have to make
an official selection.

52
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,900
Simply decide at the end of eight
weeks whether you want to stop and

53
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,310
a collect statements of accomplishments or
continue for

54
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,160
the final two weeks to get
a distinction certificates.

55
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,320
Notice that the certificates
are awarded for

56
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,620
completion of the appropriate course,
not the grade you get.

57
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,080
You will receive your aggregate score,
but it will be

58
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,560
in the cover letter to your certificate,
not on the certificate itself.

59
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,800
This is because the points awarded have
little significance outside the course.

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,700
Their relevance is within the course.

61
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,420
The course treats points like the points
that are awarded in a video game.

62
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,750
They have significance inside the game,
but no value outside.

63
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,420
You should use them as a guide
to measure your progress.

64
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,290
If you're new to the topics
covered in this course,

65
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,730
a grade of 35% on a problem
set can be a good result.

66
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,037
Just as happens in many video games,

67
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:30,877
to get high scores, you have to
keep coming back and trying again.

68
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:37,810
A bit lower down the page, there's also
section on the underlying cause pedagogy.

69
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,450
Chances are, unless you've been
a student at a good college or

70
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,500
university, you may never have experienced
a course with a structure as this one.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,130
You should definitely read
this section carefully.

72
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,940
Also, watch the 20 minute
video linked to it.

73
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,250
The pedagogy paragraph and that video
explain why you don't see my tutorial

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,330
explanations of assigned work until
after you've attempted to complete it.

75
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,700
The course isn't about whether you
can solve the assigned problems.

76
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,800
It's about attempting them.

77
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,290
To put it bluntly, if you can do
most of the assigned problems,

78
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,880
you really don't need this course.

79
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,510
The next section, course structure,
describes how the course is

80
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,110
constructed to embody those
underlying pedagogic principles.

81
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,850
Like the previous page, it's long and
packed with valuable information.

82
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,150
The one point I want to emphasize,
is the statement that the assignments and

83
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,330
problem sets are the heart of the course.

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,780
It's when you're struggling with those
problems that the actual learning will

85
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,380
take place and you will struggle.

86
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,220
Perhaps not in the first couple of weeks,
but for sure, before the course is done.

87
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,810
Though the lecture and tutorial videos are
the visible part of a Mooc, in my course,

88
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,490
their purpose is mostly to give you
a bit of background information and

89
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,700
provide examples of mathematical thinking.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,890
They're not instructional, and

91
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,290
they won't show you how to do
any of the assignment problems.

92
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,750
Now it may not be what you're used to,

93
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,220
but it is how mathematics
is learned at university.

94
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,780
It has to be done that way.

95
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,940
Since the goal is to acquire
the ability to solve a novel problem,

96
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,450
it doesn't help you, for me to show
you how to solve specific examples.

97
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,450
The only way to acquire that ability,
is to keep trying and

98
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,350
failing, until you get it.

99
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,910
That's why this course rewards time
spent and effort, not performance.

100
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,360
The only attempts you make that
are graded at all are the problem sets,

101
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,550
in both versions of the course.

102
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,320
The problem sets consist of typical
assignment problems, for which you

103
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,450
enter an answer on the course website and
receive a machine-assigned grade.

104
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,029
The primary purpose of those grades is to
give you some feedback on your progress.

105
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,180
This is particularly helpful for

106
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,430
students taking this course a second,
or even a third time.

107
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,360
The only other relevance
of the machine grids,

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,030
is to determine what constitute
completion of the course.

109
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,180
Check out the last page in the course
information section, grading and

110
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,450
statements of accomplishment, to see
how the final grades are computed, and

111
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,380
certificates awarded.

112
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,060
I'll leave you to check out
the remaining parts of the website,

113
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,120
once the course is under way.

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,060
For now, just concentrate on
the pages I just discussed.

115
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,670
Finally, if you want to know more
about the design of this course and

116
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:56,200
pedagogy behind it,
check out my blog, mooctalk.org.

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,940
I've been blogging about this course since
I started work on the first version,

118
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,060
back in spring 2012.

119
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,710
On the course readings page,

120
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,310
I provide links to some particular posts
I think you definitely should read.

121
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,434
I know from experience that many students
need to know why things are set up

122
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:17,555
a certain way.

123
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:22,330
Many of those blog posts were written in
response to student comments from previous

124
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,220
sessions of this course.

125
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,720
So chances are, by now,

126
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,020
any question you have will already
have been addressed on that blog.

127
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,910
Okay.

128
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,490
I suggest you now spend some time becoming
very familiar with the site structure and

129
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,040
the parts I've drawn your attention to.

130
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,220
You can look into
the evaluation rubric and

131
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,780
check out test flight once
the course is underway.

132
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,480
They're not relevant in
the first couple of weeks.

133
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,101
And the ride is about to begin.
