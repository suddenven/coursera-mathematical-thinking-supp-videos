Most of us encounter probabilities in 
games of chance. 
If a die is rolled a great many times, 
then on average the one will come up one 
sixth of the time. 
Its probability is one sixth. 
The basic mathematics of calculating 
probabilities was worked out by the 
French mathematicians Fermat and Pascal 
in the seventeenth century. 
Bayes added an intriguing new twist to 
that theory. 
He showed how what you already know can 
change the odds.

 >> These people, dressed as they are, 
come from all over the United States to 
make deals here in the marketplace of 
America, Let's Make A Deal. 
And now here's America's top trader, TV's 
big dealer, Monte Hall. 
[NOISE]. 
 >> One way to understand Bayes' idea is 
by considering the probability puzzle 
first by the contestants in the popular 
1950s TV game show, Let's Make a Deal. 
 >> [INAUDIBLE] it's time for the big 
deal.And the big deal tonight 
is[CROSSTALK]. 
 >> Each week, at a particular moment in 
the show, the host, Monty Hall, asked the 
contestant to guess which of the three 
doors concealed a prize[CROSSTALK]. 
 >> Door Number 2, Door Number 3, which 
one would you like? 
 >> Let's say you choose Door 1. 
You have a one third probability of 
winning. 
And that's exactly the same for the other 
two doors. 
Here's where it gets interesting. 
Monty Hall doesn't let you open your 
door. 
Instead, he opens of the other two doors. 
Say, Door 3, revealing an empty space. 
Now, he asks you if you want to change 
your choice, from Door 1 to Door 2. 
So, what do you do? 
Do you stick with your original choice or 
do you switch? 
If you think it makes no difference, then 
you're wrong. 
If you switch, it actually doubles your 
chance of being right. 
Here's why. 
When you choose Door 1, the probability 
the prize is behind it, is one third. 
That means the chance that the prize is 
behind one of the other two doors is one 
third plus one third or two thirds. 
When Monte Hall eliminates Door 3, those 
odds pass to Door 2 alone. 
Thus, switching from Door 1 to Door 2 
doubles your chances of winning.

 >> Yes, that represents a $50 gift 
certificate from Big Boy Family 
Restaurants. 
Famous for their original[CROSSTALK]. 
 >> Bayes would have had no problem 
explaining what's happened. 
It's all to do with prior information. 
Because the host knows which door has the 
prize behind it, and opens one that 
doesn't, this knowledge changes the odds. 
[SOUND]. 
Not convinced? 
[MUSIC]. 
Well try the puzzle again with a 100 
doors. 
Let's say you choose door 33. 
Now, the host opens all the remaining 
doors except one. 
Would you still stick or would you 
switch? 
The chance of your guess being right is 
only 1 in a 100. 
But as Bayes would tell you, the host's 
knowledge has changed the odds for the 
remaining door to 99 hundreths. 
It's tricky, isn't it? 
What this shows is that it can be hard 
figuring the odds when someone has prior 
knowledge.
