Okay so there's a moderately reasonable 
attempt at, at the full name. 
So this around 800 current era. 
And he wrote one book in about 1825, On 
The Calculation with Hindu Numerals. 
That was a book on arithmetic using Hindu 
numerals . 
And then a few years later, he wrote this 
book and in the title of that book, 
you'll see that phrase al-jabr, and 
that's where we get the word algebra 
from, because this was the world's first 
recognizable algebra book, and that was 
the focus of the book. 
And that phrase in there, at the end of 
it, really means restoration and 
confrontation. 
Those terms that we saw a moment ago in 
connection with Diophantus. 
The way of solving an equation move 
things from one side to the other and 
remove equal terms from both sides. 
if you want to translate the whole thing 
and again I've got this translation from 
one of the leading scholars of the 
period. 
The Abridged Book on Calculation by 
Restoration and Confrontation would be a 
modern scholarly translation. 
it's usually however, known among 
scholars as just the abridged book on 
algebra, because nowadays we would just 
refer to restoration and confrontation as 
just as the key methods for solving 
equations, so it's algebra. 
And the question that people like me get 
asked when we teach students that are not 
necessarily enamored buy mathematics, is 
not at Stanford, but I mean if you go 
elsewhere, then they'll say, what's this 
useful for? 
Is this really any use? 
Well, let's go back to the source. 
al-Khwarizmi's book is essentially a 
modern algebra book. 
You know, the lang, the language has 
changed and we've got better examples, 
and these days we have full color 
illustrations and all that kind of thing. 
But if you go back there you've really 
got the beginnings of the modern algebra 
book. 
and al-Khwarizmi answers the question. 
Here's what he says, what is easiest and 
most useful in arthritic? 
This is what the book is about, such as 
men constantly requiring cases of 
inheritance, legacies, partition, 
lawsuits, and trade, and in all their 
dealings with one another, or where the 
measuring of lands, the digging of 
canals, geometric computations and other 
objects of various sorts and kinds of 
concern . 
It doesn't get more fundamental than 
that, this is basic commerce. 
This is how people trade and live and 
enter legal dealings and deal with their 
finances. 
So algebra was introduced for very very 
practical reasons. 
One thing that is characteristic of 
almost all the writings of what's known 
as Arabic mathematics, meaning the 
writings that were preserved in the 
Arabic writing. 
and that, you know, all sorts of people 
were involved. 
there were Persians, there were people 
whose natural language was Arabic there 
were Jews, there were Christians floating 
around, there were people floating around 
in the Middle East all over the place, 
and in Spain, doing work. 
And But it was the, the language in which 
just, just as we talk about Greek 
mathematics, much of which is done by 
Egyptians, but it Greek was the language 
it was echoed in, it was this phrase 
Arabic mathematics which really means it 
was recorded and stored in the Arabic 
language. 
okay, but its, it gets extremely useful. 
I'm very particular, certainly the 
interest, I love the Greek's interest. 
Was very much one of a sort of leisurely 
pursuit, an intellectual pursuit. 
The Greeks, as famously known, thought of 
mathematics, particularly geometry, as 
an, as a, as a, as a pursuit of the mind, 
something for the leisured classes to do, 
something to think about to, to, to 
improve your mind. 
go to the Muslim world in the 8th or 9th 
century, it was driven primarily through 
very practical reasons. 
They were engineers, they were traders. 
And so [COUGH], this was designed to be 
an, to improve the way of doing business. 
[COUGH] there's an image from a I, I 
forget the date on that one but it's an 
image that managed to get all over the 
date from one version of that book but if 
you look at the contents of the of the 
book and this is not meant to be a 
translation from there this is just a 
summary from the contents of the book. 
This is it, basically in that book he 
takes linear quadratic equations. 
And actually at the end of last week we 
had, I had a discussion with a couple of 
people as to why there was this huge 
focus on quadratics? 
And you know, and the answer is if you're 
a practical person, you can do an awful 
lot in the world with linear equations. 
Sometimes things change at different 
rates and linear doesn't work. 
The next best thing is quadratic, and 
within, within a certain range of 
tolerance, that's as far as you need to 
go. 
You know, even an exponential curve looks 
quadratic over a small interval, so it's 
just a reasonably good approximation. 
Look through physics books [COUGH]. 
Physics books, classical physics books, 
are full of linear and quadratic 
equations. 
Well, it's just because that was already 
difficult enough and good enough for 
doing an awful lot of things. 
You know, and as physics developed, 
people would realize that there were o-, 
there were higher order terms that you 
needed to take into account, but of a 
reasonable areas of, of, of accuracy that 
will do. 
Same with computer graphics, right? 
You, you can, you can draw almost with a 
computer graphics package that will draw 
straight lines and quadratics. 
You just put them together in a suitable 
way. 
So these, you can, you can do piece wise, 
linear and piece wise quadratic curves, 
and get all kinds of nice shapes. 
[COUGH] Okay so this was really 
developing machinery that was really 
useful. 
you might ask yourself, why regard these 
as different? 
Because we don't today, we just talk 
about quadratics, which is ax squared 
plus bx plus c equals 0, and that's a 
quadratic. 
Well, the reason was they didn't have 
negative numbers in their calculations. 
So they had to take account of whether 
the a's and the b's, these were all 
positive, so you had to put them on 
different sides in the first place. 
In fact, their conception of negative 
numbers was really unusual. 
the confronta-, those words restoration 
and confrontation, confrontation is 
really sort of easy. 
You've got equal things on both sides 
that confront each other. 
Well, if they confront each other, you 
can remove them. 
Restoration means, you restore the value, 
instead of dealing with a negative term, 
so they, they wouldn't have something 
like 10 minus X. 
What they would say is you've got a 10 
and it's, it loses weight. 
It goes on a diet and it loses x pounds, 
xo you've got a slimmed down 10, but it's 
still positive. 
You know, you gotta you take something 
then you work with it you get a number, 
you do something and at the end you 
restore it's value. 
Which we would say is adding expect able 
size, but that's not how they thought 
about it they, they, they didn't have 
subtraction and they didn't have 
negatives, so they just thought of 
diminished quantities that were still 10 
minus x was still a 10. 
It was a 10 that has lost weight, you're 
reason with that then you restore to the 
end. 
It's hard to get into that mindset now 
because we know there's other way of 
thinking about it. 
But that was, that was how we, if you 
want to understand the writing, you have 
to understand that they didn't have 
subtraction. 
You couldn't subtract from both sides, 
you can diminish something. 
And was where the word restoration came 
from, you restored the value of the 
thing.
