 >> There was an article several weeks ago or 
a month ago in the New York Times about 
the great disservice done to our 
educational system by requiring high 
school students to. 
 >> Oh, Hacker, that guy Hacker, yes. 
Can you comment on that[CROSSTALK]? 
 >> I already have in public, but[LAUGH] I 
could do it again. 
couple of things. 
If his article was about, the great 
disservice that's done to our kids by 
teaching them what we currently teach 
them in their high school algebra class, 
I'm 100% on his side. 
But he didn't. 
He said, we shouldn't be teaching 
algebra. 
What he should have said is, we need to 
teach algebra, instead of that excuse 
that's taught in the schools for algebra. 
Yeah? 
I hope you're recording me, so[LAUGH] I'm 
going to get slaughtered by this. 
No It, it's, what's taught is not 
algebra. 
If you go back and look at what 
Al-Khwarizmi was talking about and say, 
this is algebra. 
This is clearly important. 
This is clearly powerful. 
This is valuable stuff, and you teach it 
in the context. 
Then it makes sense and everyone can see 
the use of it. 
I guarantee, that the person who wrote 
that, and probably almost all students In 
the course of their everyday life or 
their recreational activities, use Excel 
spreadsheets to do things. 
Excel is an implementation in silicon of 
algebra. 
That's what it is. 
It's a, a spreadsheet is modern algebra. 
A modern implementation of algebra. 
So anyone who could, was, keeps track of 
sports scores, or runs, runs events, or 
keeps track of their finances using a 
spreadsheet, they are using algebra right 
there and then. 
So Hocka was saying, we don't need 
spreadsheets, and you don't need to know 
about them. 
That's what he was actually saying, but 
he didn't realize that. 
So, it's a matter of what he was getting 
at and he missed the point but if it was 
a matter of what's taught that's a 
different issue. 
 >> So, I mean I don't use spreadsheets that 
much but they seem more arithmetical than 
algebraic. 
 >> Yeah in terms of the. 
No but. 
That's right because the issue is and 
this is really why. 
it, it was sort of implicit in what the 
the, the traders were doing in 89th 
century, in, in the Muslim empire when 
they were doing the trading. 
What they're saying is, there were 
calculations which you have to apply 
again and again and again, and the 
numbers change. 
If you're trading, you're multiplying by 
an exchange rate, you're doing something, 
you're doing this, and it's the same 
calculation essentially, but the numbers 
change. 
So if you have a method that tells you 
how to do it for any numbers whatsoever, 
you're at the level of algebra. 
And then the spreadsheets, that's what 
spreadsheets do. 
The do arithmetic efficiently, so that 
you just change the numbers and then you 
just, literally now, you just sort of 
pull the cursor down and it does the same 
calculation for all of them. 
So it's doing algebra but still the 
algebra in the sense of[INAUDIBLE] 
because it is applied to numbers. 
The focus is on calculation but it's 
general methods for solving problems that 
are all essentially alike and once you 
looking attempt to general methods your 
level of algebra, which is why when I 
solved about Babylonians I said this is 
really algebra. 
They were writing down a formula, they 
were writing down instructions for 
dealing with specific numbers but the way 
they were writing it, was saying take any 
number and do this and this and this and 
the moment you start seeing take any 
number your essentially doing algebra. 
Fortunately the guy that worked in the 
New York Times know that you know this. 
I tend to avoid writing about something, 
publicly, that I don't really 
understand[LAUGH]. 
And, I think he overstepped the lines 
there. 
But if he'd said, what my kids are 
learning in the algebra class, hey, I'm 
on his side. 
But I think that means we should reform 
what's going on in the algebra class.
