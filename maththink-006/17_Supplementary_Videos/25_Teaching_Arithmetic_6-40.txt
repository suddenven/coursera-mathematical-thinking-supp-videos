Now here, and this also goes for, for 
most of Europe, western Europe at least 
certainly for these countries that are 
essentially capitalist. 
we build our number system on commerce 
and trade. 
Okay, we start with counting numbers and 
elementary arithmetic. 
And this is typically how we teach kids 
in, in arithmetic. 
Then we proceed to fractions, then we 
introduce negative numbers as best you 
can, it's tricky that one. 
Smart kids ask questions that are very 
difficult to answer. 
then we slip in real numbers under the 
heading algebra, we just, we pretend 
there's not a problem there. 
And from the point of view of a teacher 
the first step is pretty good, there were 
good metaphors for counting, I mean, you 
list all you can't count. 
You can think of all sorts of metaphors 
for dealing with positive numbers. 
fractions is pretty good, you can talk 
about breaking things away, I mean you 
know, American mathematics book are 
talking about pizzas, but I guess that 
reflects just American diet. 
European text books we, we cut up 
straight lines, and squares, and 
rectangles, and pies, actually we don't 
cut up pizzas in Europe, we cut up pies. 
Which is misleading, because pie tends to 
mean something else, but anyway. 
but there are good metaphors about 
sharing out infractions. 
maybe the numbers are sort of, you, you 
read all sorts of weird stuff about, 
helium balloons on balances, and things. 
which is a really weak and misleading 
metaphor, but anyway, there's, there's 
also some problems here, and and kids 
sort of get lost. 
And, many in[UNKNOWN] has enormous 
trouble really knowing what negative 
numbers are, you know, minus times minus 
equals plus the reason why we won't 
discuss. 
[LAUGH] it was, it was[UNKNOWN] I think 
it was. 
[NOISE] And in fact, most people actually 
can't give a good explanation of why 
minus one times minus one is plus one. 
And it's not 'cuz they're stupid, it's 
because it's actually kind of a tricky 
thing to do. 
and this one, this is the famous don't 
ask, don't tell policy. 
You just don't raise the issue, you just 
say, well, there's no problem here, we 
just have these continuous lines. 
and, and then students get to university, 
and they look at the construction of the 
real numbers from the rational numbers 
they think,[SOUND] I'm not going to be a 
mathematician. 
[COUGH] OK and that's more or less a 
historical thread, starting in Sumeria 
and going through sort of commerce driven 
society. 
In fact, the rest of today's lecture is 
going to be about how it came. 
The Western Europe and then the United 
States was the dominant economic power 
for many centuries. 
Why is the word banking from an Italian 
word, why is the word policy from an 
Italian word, why is double entry book 
keeping coming out of Italy. 
Why are financial districts often called 
long bad street, why is all of the 
terminology about banking and finance and 
insurance and international trip, why is 
so much of that Italian? 
I'll come to that in the second half of 
the lecture. 
That was a case where mathematics really 
drove modern society and gave dominance 
to first Italy and then Germany, then 
Western Europe and then Unites States. 
And just took over from the rest of the 
world in economics. 
And with it, science as well. 
Why is it that Galileo was in Pisa? 
Just it, why did it all happen in Italy? 
Something happened there. 
Well, several things happened, but, one 
of them was to do with the, with this 
sequence of learning. 
But there's another way you could learn 
about[INAUDIBLE] , the[UNKNOWN] 
educational system. 
And this one was developed in the Soviet 
Union. 
I'm not sure if it's still used very much 
in Russia,[COUGH] . 
this is known as the, the Davydov 
curriculum. 
who was a Russian psychologist and 
educator. 
Died not, not that long ago, Vasily 
Davydov. 
And he said we should start with the, you 
see, the problem with that last picture 
was going from the rationals, what, the, 
the negative numbers is a problem, but 
going to the real numbers is a real 
problem. 
You've got the don't ask, don't tell 
policy. 
It's really very difficult conceptually, 
and he said, we've got a concept of, of 
measurement, that predates, by hundreds 
of thousands of years, counting, namely, 
measurements of lengths and things. 
Most creatures have a sense of distance 
and length. 
They use it to sort of catch prey, to 
swing from tree to tree, I mean, there's 
an innate sense of distance, in many 
creatures, much more sophisticated than a 
sense of con, of con, of counting. 
Counting is, discreet counting is much 
more restrictive in the, in the animal 
world. 
Okay, so, most creatures, including 
humans, have this very rich sense of, of 
quantative measurement. 
He said we should build our number system 
and, we should begin with the real 
numbers, and with algebra, and then 
arithmetic will drop out as a special 
case, which is true. 
because when you have the real numbers, 
the natural numbers are just points on a 
line, and it's just a particular instance 
of these things. 
So he said it's better to begin with this 
rich sense of distance and volume that we 
had for a millennia. 
[COUGH] and in building a curriculum he 
took Vygotsky's ideas and talked about 
spontaneous concepts by scientific 
concepts and these are all technical 
terms, which I won't go into details 
about but we can chat about them offline 
sometime. 
Spontaneous concepts, when children just 
abstract from everyday experiences. 
But human beings don't just abstract, 
they theorize. 
And they can theorize from a very early 
age, and in fact they do, I mean, very 
young children theorize a lot of things. 
They form theories at a very early age. 
And he says with a bit of, with a bit of 
nudging, you can take those ideas, of the 
theorizing capacity and develop what he 
calls scientific concepts. 
And this allows you to build a curriculum 
in which you get very naturally, at a 
very early age, from the age of something 
like six to eight. 
You can begin by doing algebra and 
solving equations, and then arithmetic 
follows special cases. 
If you are interested, I have a, an 
online column called Devling's Angle that 
the MEA. 
If you just type Devling's Angle and you 
go back to 2008, 2009, Christmas around 
2008, 2007. 
I actually had two articles on these. 
it's actually hard to find much about 
this. 
This is written about a lot in the 
educational research literature. 
my two articles are almost the only 
articles I've seen and come across that 
tries to explain these things to a 
general audience. 
But there's another way, and so these 
different cognitions can be taken 
advantage of for educational purposes.
