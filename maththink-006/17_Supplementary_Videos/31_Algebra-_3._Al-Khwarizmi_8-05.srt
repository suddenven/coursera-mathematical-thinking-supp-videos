1
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:20,740
Okay so there's a moderately reasonable 
attempt at, at the full name. 

2
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:27,860
So this around 800 current era. 
And he wrote one book in about 1825, On 

3
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:34,546
The Calculation with Hindu Numerals. 
That was a book on arithmetic using Hindu 

4
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:37,813
numerals . 
And then a few years later, he wrote this 

5
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:41,931
book and in the title of that book, 
you'll see that phrase al-jabr, and 

6
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:46,475
that's where we get the word algebra 
from, because this was the world's first 

7
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:50,258
recognizable algebra book, and that was 
the focus of the book. 

8
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:57,43
And that phrase in there, at the end of 
it, really means restoration and 

9
00:00:57,43 --> 00:01:00,365
confrontation. 
Those terms that we saw a moment ago in 

10
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:04,82
connection with Diophantus. 
The way of solving an equation move 

11
00:01:04,82 --> 00:01:07,598
things from one side to the other and 
remove equal terms from both sides. 

12
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:13,394
if you want to translate the whole thing 
and again I've got this translation from 

13
00:01:13,394 --> 00:01:16,390
one of the leading scholars of the 
period. 

14
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,567
The Abridged Book on Calculation by 
Restoration and Confrontation would be a 

15
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:27,412
modern scholarly translation. 
it's usually however, known among 

16
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:32,352
scholars as just the abridged book on 
algebra, because nowadays we would just 

17
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:37,292
refer to restoration and confrontation as 
just as the key methods for solving 

18
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:42,753
equations, so it's algebra. 
And the question that people like me get 

19
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:49,834
asked when we teach students that are not 
necessarily enamored buy mathematics, is 

20
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:56,42
not at Stanford, but I mean if you go 
elsewhere, then they'll say, what's this 

21
00:01:56,42 --> 00:01:58,210
useful for? 
Is this really any use? 

22
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:03,655
Well, let's go back to the source. 
al-Khwarizmi's book is essentially a 

23
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:06,600
modern algebra book. 
You know, the lang, the language has 

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,420
changed and we've got better examples, 
and these days we have full color 

25
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,390
illustrations and all that kind of thing. 
But if you go back there you've really 

26
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,946
got the beginnings of the modern algebra 
book. 

27
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:22,856
and al-Khwarizmi answers the question. 
Here's what he says, what is easiest and 

28
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:26,898
most useful in arthritic? 
This is what the book is about, such as 

29
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:30,738
men constantly requiring cases of 
inheritance, legacies, partition, 

30
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:34,834
lawsuits, and trade, and in all their 
dealings with one another, or where the 

31
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:38,994
measuring of lands, the digging of 
canals, geometric computations and other 

32
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:41,580
objects of various sorts and kinds of 
concern . 

33
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,60
It doesn't get more fundamental than 
that, this is basic commerce. 

34
00:02:45,60 --> 00:02:49,540
This is how people trade and live and 
enter legal dealings and deal with their 

35
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,365
finances. 
So algebra was introduced for very very 

36
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:56,660
practical reasons. 
One thing that is characteristic of 

37
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,125
almost all the writings of what's known 
as Arabic mathematics, meaning the 

38
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,643
writings that were preserved in the 
Arabic writing. 

39
00:03:02,643 --> 00:03:06,520
and that, you know, all sorts of people 
were involved. 

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,265
there were Persians, there were people 
whose natural language was Arabic there 

41
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:15,945
were Jews, there were Christians floating 
around, there were people floating around 

42
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,405
in the Middle East all over the place, 
and in Spain, doing work. 

43
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:23,563
And But it was the, the language in which 
just, just as we talk about Greek 

44
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:27,853
mathematics, much of which is done by 
Egyptians, but it Greek was the language 

45
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:32,77
it was echoed in, it was this phrase 
Arabic mathematics which really means it 

46
00:03:32,77 --> 00:03:34,872
was recorded and stored in the Arabic 
language. 

47
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:40,950
okay, but its, it gets extremely useful. 
I'm very particular, certainly the 

48
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,644
interest, I love the Greek's interest. 
Was very much one of a sort of leisurely 

49
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:50,350
pursuit, an intellectual pursuit. 
The Greeks, as famously known, thought of 

50
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:55,366
mathematics, particularly geometry, as 
an, as a, as a, as a pursuit of the mind, 

51
00:03:55,366 --> 00:04:00,230
something for the leisured classes to do, 
something to think about to, to, to 

52
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,514
improve your mind. 
go to the Muslim world in the 8th or 9th 

53
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:09,420
century, it was driven primarily through 
very practical reasons. 

54
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,982
They were engineers, they were traders. 
And so [COUGH], this was designed to be 

55
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:19,562
an, to improve the way of doing business. 
[COUGH] there's an image from a I, I 

56
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:24,892
forget the date on that one but it's an 
image that managed to get all over the 

57
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:30,58
date from one version of that book but if 
you look at the contents of the of the 

58
00:04:30,58 --> 00:04:34,978
book and this is not meant to be a 
translation from there this is just a 

59
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:40,130
summary from the contents of the book. 
This is it, basically in that book he 

60
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:46,138
takes linear quadratic equations. 
And actually at the end of last week we 

61
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:50,225
had, I had a discussion with a couple of 
people as to why there was this huge 

62
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:53,738
focus on quadratics? 
And you know, and the answer is if you're 

63
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:58,140
a practical person, you can do an awful 
lot in the world with linear equations. 

64
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,430
Sometimes things change at different 
rates and linear doesn't work. 

65
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,265
The next best thing is quadratic, and 
within, within a certain range of 

66
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,541
tolerance, that's as far as you need to 
go. 

67
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,819
You know, even an exponential curve looks 
quadratic over a small interval, so it's 

68
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,66
just a reasonably good approximation. 
Look through physics books [COUGH]. 

69
00:05:17,66 --> 00:05:21,96
Physics books, classical physics books, 
are full of linear and quadratic 

70
00:05:21,96 --> 00:05:24,706
equations. 
Well, it's just because that was already 

71
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:28,26
difficult enough and good enough for 
doing an awful lot of things. 

72
00:05:28,26 --> 00:05:31,866
You know, and as physics developed, 
people would realize that there were o-, 

73
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:35,586
there were higher order terms that you 
needed to take into account, but of a 

74
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,190
reasonable areas of, of, of accuracy that 
will do. 

75
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,460
Same with computer graphics, right? 
You, you can, you can draw almost with a 

76
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,270
computer graphics package that will draw 
straight lines and quadratics. 

77
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,540
You just put them together in a suitable 
way. 

78
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,694
So these, you can, you can do piece wise, 
linear and piece wise quadratic curves, 

79
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:56,992
and get all kinds of nice shapes. 
[COUGH] Okay so this was really 

80
00:05:56,992 --> 00:06:01,397
developing machinery that was really 
useful. 

81
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:05,815
you might ask yourself, why regard these 
as different? 

82
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:10,341
Because we don't today, we just talk 
about quadratics, which is ax squared 

83
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:13,270
plus bx plus c equals 0, and that's a 
quadratic. 

84
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,62
Well, the reason was they didn't have 
negative numbers in their calculations. 

85
00:06:18,62 --> 00:06:22,605
So they had to take account of whether 
the a's and the b's, these were all 

86
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:27,149
positive, so you had to put them on 
different sides in the first place. 

87
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,274
In fact, their conception of negative 
numbers was really unusual. 

88
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:38,944
the confronta-, those words restoration 
and confrontation, confrontation is 

89
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:42,76
really sort of easy. 
You've got equal things on both sides 

90
00:06:42,76 --> 00:06:45,986
that confront each other. 
Well, if they confront each other, you 

91
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:50,33
can remove them. 
Restoration means, you restore the value, 

92
00:06:50,33 --> 00:06:55,247
instead of dealing with a negative term, 
so they, they wouldn't have something 

93
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:58,990
like 10 minus X. 
What they would say is you've got a 10 

94
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,783
and it's, it loses weight. 
It goes on a diet and it loses x pounds, 

95
00:07:03,783 --> 00:07:08,205
xo you've got a slimmed down 10, but it's 
still positive. 

96
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:12,741
You know, you gotta you take something 
then you work with it you get a number, 

97
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:16,100
you do something and at the end you 
restore it's value. 

98
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,452
Which we would say is adding expect able 
size, but that's not how they thought 

99
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:24,464
about it they, they, they didn't have 
subtraction and they didn't have 

100
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:28,816
negatives, so they just thought of 
diminished quantities that were still 10 

101
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:32,758
minus x was still a 10. 
It was a 10 that has lost weight, you're 

102
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:35,740
reason with that then you restore to the 
end. 

103
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,363
It's hard to get into that mindset now 
because we know there's other way of 

104
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:40,955
thinking about it. 
But that was, that was how we, if you 

105
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:45,115
want to understand the writing, you have 
to understand that they didn't have 

106
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:47,623
subtraction. 
You couldn't subtract from both sides, 

107
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:52,191
you can diminish something. 
And was where the word restoration came 

108
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:55,244
from, you restored the value of the 
thing. 

109
00:07:55,244 --> 00:08:04,113
[MUSIC] 

110
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:05,387
.
