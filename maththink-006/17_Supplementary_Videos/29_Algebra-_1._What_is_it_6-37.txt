Welcome back, and there's two topics 
tonight, the first is the one I began in 
just sort of got into a little bit at the 
beginning, at the end of last time. 
And so, I'll pick up on that, actually 
think about the birth of algebra. 
Which is part of a general sort of 
historical theme that's going to be 
running through this. 
But I'm also into sparsing it with sort 
of more up to date things, and given the 
events in the political arena, the second 
half is going to be about how do we count 
the votes in a general election. 
Okay? 
And the spoiler is you tell me who you 
want to win and I can give you a fair way 
to count the votes so that person will 
win. 
 >> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] . 
 >> Okay? 
So, you know? 
 >> [INAUDIBLE] 
 >> It's, it's not who wins, well actually, 
it could be who wins the debate that can 
really get into the White House, but 
really the game is won or lost when you 
decide how you're going to count the 
votes. 
So that would be the second half. 
Okay, I'll go a little bit, I'll go 
fairly quickly for the first couple of 
minutes, because we, we got into this 
last time, and this is about the birth of 
algebra. 
And I pointed out that we need to be 
careful what we mean by algebra. 
In fact, even today, there were two 
meanings. 
There's what I'd called sophisticated, or 
aritmatical thinking, or meta 
arithmetical thinking, which is the, the 
kind of, which is what most people think 
of as algebra. 
It's what's the basis of algebra in the 
high school system. 
And then there's what mathematicians call 
algebra, sometimes known as higher 
algebra. 
[COUGH] Okay. 
Well first of all, and, and the focus 
mainly is going to be almost exclusively 
is on the former, which is algebra as it 
arose out of arithmetic as a, as a way of 
improving arithmetic calculations. 
So I'm not going to be touching on higher 
algebra, [SOUND] which is what is done, 
so if you say that, if you come, if you 
go around the, if you go around the 
Stanford campus, you're going to math 
department, and you go into an office and 
someone says this is professor X, and 
professor X is an algebraist, this is not 
what professor X does. 
Professor X does something very 
different. 
Perhaps works on something like Fermat's 
last theoroem. 
Although that turned out not to be 
algebraic in the end, but that's another 
story. 
Okay, certainly not algebra, because it 
uses symbols. 
In fact, algebra, for many years, was 
written, in a non symbolic fashion. 
It was always done symbolically. 
by the way, I will mention that, if you 
start going on the web, and you go to, 
even to Wikipedia and you look for 
accounts on algebra, there's a lot of 
misinformation floating out there. 
That's one of the, Wikipedia's actually 
pretty good on a lot of mathematical 
content, but the last time I looked, in 
terms of the history of algebra, it was 
really very weak. 
Largely, because it was based on the few 
textbooks that were available, that 
people have access to, most of which are 
actually quite old, and scholarship has, 
has advanced quite a bit since then. 
[COUGH] Okay, so this is one of those 
instances where beware of what you find 
on the web. 
Okay, we certainly so, it, it's not 
because it's symbolic that makes it 
arguable, it's the kind of thinking 
that's going on. 
[COUGH] and in fact the symbolic part 
although you can trace it back to these 
fairly early origins it really wasn't 
until, even later than the 13th century, 
that that we get modern symbolic algebra. 
In fact 16 centuries when you can first 
really identify the work of Phan's Viete, 
Viete you can really recognize symbolic 
algebra in the modern sense. 
Okay, so, the key distinction is it's a 
logical thinking rather than numerical 
quantity thinking. 
it's not calculating with numbers, it's 
reasoning logically about numbers. 
so whereas arithmetic is definitely 
quantitative, algebra is very much a 
qualitative discipline. 
But it's focused on numbers, this kind of 
algebra is still focused on numbers. 
And one of the ways to distinguish it is 
where was in calculation, you have some 
data, and you do things to that data to 
get an answer. 
You can't get it with the data, you add 
numbers together, you multiply them, and 
it's a forward looking thing where you're 
combining things. 
You're, you're literally not getting new 
information, you're combining information 
you've got. 
In order to get a result that was already 
implicit in that data. 
one of the features of algebra, is it's a 
little bit different. 
You know that there's an answer out 
there, you give it a name, and then you 
sort of almost work backwards. 
You reason what, would have to happen to 
get to that thing. 
So you reason, logically, in order to, to 
determine that value. 
now it doesn't matter whether you call 
that unknown by a name, and in fact in 
medieval mathematics, it was used by 
terms that really meant the thing. 
You do this to the thing, you do that to 
the thing and then you find out that the 
thing is this. 
so there were various terms in Latin and 
other languages which really translate as 
the thing. 
and it only became known as the x, 
solving for x, was more like 16, 17th 
century. 
So it's not to do with the language. 
And, you know, my knowledge with, with 
music, music is transcends the musical 
notation, and algebra transcends any 
particular notation. 
It's the way of thinking that that 
distinguishes it. 
[COUGH] So my, one of the things I 
mentioned last time was that, taking a 
formula and putting numbers in is 
outright arithmetic but the deriving of 
that formula in the first place usually 
involves qualitative, what we might call 
algebraic reasoning. 
And the examples I gave, again, last time 
very quickly was solving a quadratic by 
guessing and calculation. 
That just doing arithmetic, you make a 
guess and then you do some calculation. 
If you're systematic and you substitute 
in a formula, that's also arithmetic. 
But if you look at the the method whereby 
the formula itself is obtained. 
Or in the case of a particular example 
like this, looking at the structure of it 
and reasoning about it then that's 
really, I mean there's a, there's a fuzzy 
borderline, and some people might 
disagree with [UNKNOWN] classifying this 
as algebraic because it is a fuzzy 
borderline. 
But I would say when you start doing 
this, you've really crossed over into 
into algebraic thinking, lets say its 
fuzzy and and you know different people 
might want to put the borderline in a 
different place. 
So I would say that's, that's, that's 
that's moved over and that's, that's, 
that's really algebra.
